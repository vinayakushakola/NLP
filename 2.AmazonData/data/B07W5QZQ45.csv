"Delivery was fast but installation & demo part takes approx 6 days.I choose the slot but guy didn't came and completed the installation process of its own on its app.Installation part is not done by 1+,they had given installation to Amazon, Amazon had given to Cloudtail,Cloudtail had given to Qdigi,Qdigi had given to another co.Guy who came to me didn't know how to set correct picture?They only know how to hang TV on wall else nothing. 3.5 mm jack is missing.Colour is better but not the best like Sony.SD channel quality is very poor,HD channel quality is poor.4k quality is good.So,if you have budget go for Sony for the best display and service after sales.If you don't have budget go for budget TV at least you will save money .If you can wait for at least 1 week for installation & demo part you can go for 1+ TV as installation co will say they are overloaded in this festive season as they have to install other company TV's also.2nd execuse will be 1+ TV is new so they don't know all about demo part.Kindly check full hd and SD picture quality before buying any TV as 4k content is not easy available in the market.",Worst installation & demo process of 1 +tv,B07W5QZQ45
"If you have used a One Plus smartphone you're already aware about how the brand gives you value for your every buck spent. If you're someone who majorly consume content online on OTT you should definitely get this TV. Please skip this if you're going to watch your satellite TV as it's still isn't that great when it comes to upscaling SD content. Pros: Brighter screen with vivid colors Android TV USB type chargeable TV remote Loud & clear sound Cons: Poor upscaling for SD content HDR content looks poor as of now Unavailability of Netflix as of now No Table top stand provided Edit: The software update has fixed the HDR issue which I was facing earlier, Netflix isn't available yet.",A ideal TV for binge watching millennials,B07W5QZQ45
"Very impressive picture quality,and very smooth OS. Remote is chargeable like a phone,and the connect app just adds to the experience.",Impressive,B07W5QZQ45
"Being a loyal OnePlus customer since OnePlus 2, had great expections from the TV. So much so that I was amongst the 1st customer to buy the TV on the 28th of September and much to my pleasure the TV was promptly delivered on the 30th. However since then the experience has been pretty horrid to say the least. The installation slot was assigned on the 2nd of October at 10 am but the technician didn't show up until 3 pm, understandably that the technician are busy due to prime sale, I didn't pay much heed. The installation didn't take place that day, admittedly due to my own reservation. Finally after calling and pleading the technician again and again the TV was finally installed on the 5th, but much to my horror, the TV had a crack on the display. Upon taking up the issue, the Amazon team agreed to replace the TV immediately. But to replace the TV the technician has to file a report on the same and because my initial installation slot was on the 2nd, it expired. I was assigned a new slot for the 7th. As of today I am still waiting for the technician to report the TV to be damaged so that I can get a replacement. Given the procedure, even thought I bought the TV on the 28th of September, sadly I won't be able to experience it before the 12th of October. The defected tv is just sitting in my living room since the 30th and just hurting my eyes everytime I look at it.",The review is more to do with service rather the quality of the tv.,B07W5QZQ45
"There are dead pixels on a brand new tv. Called customer care multiple times since last 3 days, no one responding with concrete solution, just buying time. I have my return window till 10 Oct only, Please return or replace. Update: Got the replacement now, and is good so far.",Dead pixels on the TV,B07W5QZQ45
5 Star for OnePlus TV as a Product. 2 Star for the installation Service. TV definitely is a great buy. Great Quality and Dolby Vision. All you can see in different youtube comparison videos. I had options either to go with Samsung Frame of OnePlus. I choose OnePlus because do not want a dedicated Art TV and samsung art TV is loaded with bloats. I myself compared both in person now I see they are almost similar. Game Of Thrones final episode on both the TV is not perfect but better than many other TV in the price range of under 1.2 Lakh. Though OnePlus is a bit cheaper than samsung frame quality is a marginally above Samsung. Sound is great on Q1 and I do not feel reviewing it as installing a separate soundbar with sub woofer is what I prefer. Pros: - Good Price Range. - QLED panel outshines everything in your living room. - Android Mobile Apps APK sideloaded are cropped towards left. (something they may need to fix. Cons: - No Cons for TV. - Amazon service is pathetic. They denied installation at my pincode and I had to go with many troubles for getting it installed locally. (it goes away from buyers pocket),Amazing TV - Poor Amazon Service,B07W5QZQ45
"Any one getting pink screen? TV has major fault of showing pinkish colour. Tried resetting TV many times. Got a defective piece. Left Half the screen was black. I must be the one in first 5customers of this TV in my town, got the tv in prime sale installed even before it went on official sale. Had such a difficult time with Amazon to get it replaced. They took 11+ days to get it replaced. That's after 7-8 hours of overall phone calls to Amazon and one+ call centers . it was quite frustrating experience. Everything that is expected from this TV is beyond expectations. All clutter is gone from my tv set. Most imp, this TV got I build sound bar with amazing quality. This helped me get rid of all wiring and devices that were required to get good sound from flat TV. You need only one wire that's power cable if nt using any hdmi source. Picture is amazing. Adjusting colors not easy. Still Having trouble to make color calibration work effectively with my ps4. Internet connectivity is amazing Adsusting sound is not easy. No preset sound modes. Remote is small sleek and useful. But not very responsive. It takes time to get response back from TV. Remember!!!! TV screen is very very very delicate. Be careful if you plan to relocate. Installation people don't know much about installation. Stand beside them to check if they follow instructions that came with TV.","Best quality picture, sound, internet and remote",B07W5QZQ45
Day1: This z my first smart tv so unable to compare with other tvs..but this QLED was awesome...enjoying Edit1: I got a defective product...the picture is showing some pinkish/reddish showing other than actual colour.i need to change the settings daily for this issue,Waiting for Netflix,B07W5QZQ45
display and sound is stunning,Awesome quality,B07W5QZQ45
"The TV is exceptional, the sound quality amazing. The thing that lets the experience down is the remote, having no mute button is especially irritating and a long press on the volume down key doesn't serve that purpose as usually it does in Mobile devices. There is also no source button, and the tv always to defaults to the Android screen. Not the last source input screen. To watch TV for elders in the house, it proves to be too much to handle. Image processing is weaker than Samsung or LG but I am hoping software updates might improve the algorithm. HD and UHD content is good but sd is horrible. (Alexa or Google assistant aren't able to mute or change source like apple home kit, adding that function might greatly improved this experience) Verdict: no brainier if you have only people less than 50yrs old in the house. Side note: The installation experience was a nightmare, that is more of reflection on Amazon home services who sent one person to do the entire installation of this 55inch qled. After a lot of calls, they sent a decent engineer and his sidekick very late in the evening. Almost ruining the entire day. That's all. I can add more photos /videos but I am recording with my phone so the excellent sound quality might not be reproduced.","Everything is great, but the remote...",B07W5QZQ45
"Did not like the TV at all. go for Samsung LG or Sony in similar price range to get all the apps running falwlessly. Very limited apps available, Netflix not available. Neither am I able to cast Netflix from my OnePlus 6t phone. Picture quality is far better when same app being played using fire stick compared to native apps. Native Prime video app also sucks. Expected much more from OnePlus, the playstore contains very limited app, almost of no use. I had a 4k TCL smart TV of cost around 30 k, I felt this TV is not doing better in any ways. The sound quality is better, but one still need good sound system.","Not at all like a OnePlus product, totally disappointed",B07W5QZQ45
"I booked the TV on the first day, just believed in OnePlus brand. But its a big letdown from them for their loyal customers. My TV have defects and I have been following up with customer care many times to sort that out but in vain. Problem: Whenever put the TV to standby from live channels and power on, it doesn't goes to live channels directly but it goes to apps page and you have to use your TV remote choose the input and then you have to use the settop box remote. Similarly, power off the TV should power off/standby the settop box as well , but it doesn't do. For both of these options are available in TV , but it doesn't work for my TV. Customer care team doesnot have any knowledge about the TV , everytime they say they will come back with solution but it never worked but they still close the case. Remote is too small to hold and have delicate buttons. It is difficult to keep it safe. Rest of them are fine.",Many defects and poor support from customer care,B07W5QZQ45
"good product but its supplying without table top stand . Nothing Special its a ordinary Television with lot of Hype created in market . you can not compare with Sony, Samsung product, its a ok ok product , not so happy with this purchase and quality of TV.",One plus lot of Hype created about the TV but actially a ordinary TV,B07W5QZQ45
Pros: + Brilliant display + Sleek rechargable Remote + Excellent sound ( I decided not to get a sound bar anymore) + Very thin bezels + Easy remote on any android phone Cons: - Non-pro version doesn't come with a table top stand - Default wall mounting stand gives very less space behind the TV - Don't search for more Cons 'cause there are none,"If you are looking for 55"" TV, go for this one",B07W5QZQ45
"Pros Good design Great SDR performance Good audio quality Handy smartphone control app Cons Disconcerting build quality Poor viewing angles Mediocre HDR performance Silly remote design No AirPlay 2 High price For that price, you are getting a television with good design, good SDR performance, and good audio. The mobile app is also handy and offers a few more features than what we normally see in these apps. Unfortunately, the build quality is concerning, the HDR performance isn't impressive, the display has mediocre viewing angles and uniformity issues and the remote is frustrating to use. We also expect some added niceties at this price like AirPlay 2 support, which is missing.",Not worth the Hype!,B07W5QZQ45

"Ok guys so, first of all, let me tell you that I was totally confused while buying this tv. There were a few concerns in my mind: 1. This brand is a well know brand in Mobile but it's their first TV, So is it safe to buy ?? 2. I am getting 55-inch tv ultra 4k at price like 35k, so should I invest 70K in TV and get the same 4k tv? 3. Should I wait for other brands like Sony, Samsung, and LG to decrease the Price of their costly TV and buy them? 4. Ok if I want to buy One Plus TV, should I buy 70k one or 1 lac tv? Answer: 1. Yes, it's right that this is Oneplus first TV but I think we should decide whether to buy this or not by seeing the feature, component, and equipment which they have used on TV. After all the equipment matters more than who assembles it. If you see the specification and component used Like Panels screens speakers, all are very good and of high quality. So definitely this TV is a very GOOD TV. It's just awesome. 2. Now if you are comparing this with TV-like MI and TCL etc around 30 - 35 K budget then u are totally wrong. These low-end tvs are not providing high-end parts and components in the TV as one plus tv. After a year use these low-end tvs start getting slow and lags bcz there are no updates given by service provide on an old tv. These service provided launches 2 -3 tv every year and they forget old tv. Now one plus clearly told they will give update upto 3 years min. so that means this tv is not going to be slow or have any software issue. 3. If you want to wait then you can wait. But let me tell u something these giants tv company if they reduce the TV Price then also they will not give high-end specs. they will reduce the feature like instead of 4 HDMI 3 HDMI, sound output will be reduced from 40watt to 20 or 10 watts and many more things. 4. If you ask me, you should buy 70 K tv not the 1 lac tv as it has only soundbar extra. Many of you will already have the soundbar /speaker in your home or even you don't have, you can buy them at lesser price in some offer. I don't think spending 30k just for the speaker makes sense. Plus, its a motorize speaker so every time u switch on tv it comes out and so on. It is bound to have wear and tear in the future. But again it's up to u what u want to buy. Pros: 1. Sound 50 Watt ( Dolby vision and Dolby atmos certified TV) 2. Picture quality ( QLED Screen is just awesome.) 3. Oxygen OS/Play ( it is so smooth like a hot knife on butter) 4. Build Quality 5.Remote (awesome remote, trust me you won't miss mute button on this remote as many are telling in youtube) Cons: 1. I am going mad in searching for one con on this tv, but I haven't found anything yet. If I find anything I will update my review. Watch this space for more update.",BEST QLED TV. Trust Me!!,B07W5QZQ45
"My overall experience with this TV Update after 1.5 month: 1) Received new replacement remote in about a months struggle and it is working ok and not charged since 15 day. 2) Experience with oneplus service was worst amazon is still novice in managing warranty claim of product. 3) I don't feel the purchase of this TV was worth even after receiving discounts. I should have gone for Sony or VU as this one is somewhere in middle and considering service support and cost premium it is not wise to go with this product. Update after 14 days: 1) Oneplus don't have there exclusive warranty service provider for tv. 2) The agency they have hired for service are expert in installation (actually mounting on wall) and cover other Chinese brand also and know nothing about TV. 3) Twice placed the warranty claim request on amazon platform. First time no one came. Second time I called amazon twice and pleaded to send technician for I was assured that my claim request will be processed on priority. Finally technician came (late anyway) with drill and hammer in the bag and said he knows installation only he played with remote for sometime asked to call amazon again which have already done. If this would have been a local seller or any other established tv brand I would have definitely managed to get service. 4) For those who don't know - warranty claim for this product can be done through amazon app and not directly by oneplus so Amazon is equally responsible for warranty claims. I am worried that I am stuck with faulty product and oneplus and Amazon don't have ability/service providers to provide warranty services for TV. Review after 5 days use: a) Poor product QA, the remote is faulty and loosing charge completely in 10 Hour. I even struggle to turn on TV as remote battery gets drained and oneplus app start TV only if it was not powered off or shutdown was not done. It can wake it up only when TV is in sleep mode. b) Boot time is on lil higher side when compared with my firetv stick. App loading and switching is faster. c) Sound quality is good compared to any other LED tv, you will not feel need of sound bar unless you are use to home theater system. d) Picture is bright and looks good but doesn't match the SAMSUNG QLED or Sony. It is good far cartoon as color are little over saturated. e) installation experience was very poor. Multiple time amazon customer support made false promises for sending someone for installation but no one came until 12 days. Got it done from outside and got installation checked from amazon technician when he came. f) Installation is simple and when you switch on tv for first time you need to follow similar procedure like for new smartphone. g) Amazon need to train delivery staff on how to open bigger TV box and show TV to customers at time of open box inspection for delivery. There are plugs given near bottom of box which needs to be removed and box is taken out but delivery staff tried to pull out the TV from top of box and my heart came in moth as they were struggling and TV was heavy. I had to guid them on this.",My overall experience with oneplus Tv - Not recommended for purchase,B07W5QZQ45
Display is too good than sony Trilluminus display. Sound quality is very good with dolby atmos.,Very good display,B07W5QZQ45
"Hardware wise, the TV is all good and all. The picture quality, even the SDR content looks pretty decent on such a widescreen. But the software as of this date is at an okay level. They need to work a lot on the coming updates, like adding Netflix, being able to change to video quality in prime video, Miracast (unable to connect my laptop wirelessly to the tv), no data saver mode, etc. When music is played at louder volumes, the base feels muffled, not punchy. So yeah, if these problems are addressed soon, then it's a perfect tv",Is it worth the hype?,B07W5QZQ45
TV is good .... however installation partner VFcare is extremely unprofessional...will not install on time ...had follow-up multiple times. service engineer Did not provide me receipt for wall bracket ..,Installation partner VFcare is not great,B07W5QZQ45
"I bought qled q1 pro the minute it was on sale. So far loving the sound quality with its 8 speaker setup. The HDR content's performance is not as good as I was expected. I experience lag in HDR videos with breakage in sound. Also, there are some bugs like mute command is not responsive via Google assistant. The remote also would have been better if it had separate buttons for play , fast forward and rewind like in Amazon firestick remote. Hope it gets updates for all the bugs and Netflix soon, otherwise the true Oneplus experience will stay missing from this TV.",A good TV but not the best one,B07W5QZQ45
"Trusting OnePlus and Amazon I ordered this product of such rate and now it turns to be my worst choice to get OnePlus's very first TV as it's not at all good with its Android software as it goes to all black screen after sometime of watching which makes it just as much irritating, we have to shut it down by guessing where the cursor would be and then again restart to watch something and then again after 10 mins it goes to black screen. And secondly it's just tooooo delicate which makes the product just not that much handy but a product to be kept in showpiece that hell yeah we have a OnePlus Android Smart QLED TV which doesn't even work properly. My homemaid was cleaning the desk under the TV and her elbow got in touch with the screen and here it is, the big crack appears on the screen. And when complaining to the company, OnePlus says that they don't know why this is happening.. might be some error in panel you have got get your panel changed for the issues you are facing and which will be costing you around 80% of the actual price and also the company can not do anything but I have to concern my problem with AMAZON as they are responsible to fix the issue , I mean what does this brand really want from us?! AND WHEN TALKING TO AMAZON GUYS,THEY TOLD US THAT THEY CAN HELP US BUT TELLING MY PROBLEM TO ONEPLUS MIGHT GET ME SOME HELP. It feels as if I am no one just left in the middle hanging and both the companies standing on either sides and laughing on the situation. Seriously this is mind harrasment for me as I am facing taunts everyday from my family about what an amazing investment I have made. I WONT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO LAY HIS HANDS ON THE PRODUCT.","0 in customer support, 0 in the quality of material used to make this product. Too delicate",B07W5QZQ45

"Dark spots appears on the TV. Unable to cast my 1+ mobile onto the TV. Remote is too minimalistic. Watching sports is a total put off. Judder & frame skipping while watching sports and some content. Auto volume reduction does not work as advertised, we'd have to manually reduce the volume. Coloured patches appear on the screen while watching 4k Content. Hoped a lot better from 1+.",Not worth the price tag!,B07W5QZQ45
Worst post sales experience. Avoid buying one plus tv . They won’t give proper post sale services.,Worst installation,B07W5QZQ45
"This review is just my opinion in layman eyes Pros: 1. Display is next level at this price. Need to watch HDR videos to experience the awesome display.. 2. Very user friendly remote app, they have tried and taken mobile remote to next level. Very easy to type. 3. Sound is very good and i don't think you need to go for pro version unless and until you have that budget and you want that fancy sliding speaker. Speakers are loud and clear. Dolby Atmos vision and sound works really well . Even in full volume no much distorsion. 4. Very bright and vivid display. 5. Beautiful, thin and beezles are ver small. 6. Official Android means almost all necessary apps available. Infact I felt that DTH is not required any more 😀 7. Looks MEMC was able to deliver smooth videos for most contents. It works. Cons. 1. When watching normal contents from DTH (SD and HD) needed some effort to adjust picture modes to watch comfortably. It took me time to adjust to watch comfortable. But you can maintain two picture modes with different setting and change when required. This is because high brightness is utilized to produce vivid sharp image for 4k contents but for normal videos display will turn too bright and you need to reduce backlight and brightness. I think this is something that OnePlus need to address in next updates. 2. Need to buy a flexible wallmount otherwise port will not be accessible. Flexible mount costs close to 3k. 3. I found it difficult to link this tv to Alexa.i am still trying. But I am not worried much about this and can't be a deal breaker. This review is from a week's usage. I will update any further observation after a months use.","Excellent display and sound, Wow at first sight",B07W5QZQ45
"Bought the TV and as promised, it was delivered on time. Installation was booked for 3rd Oct but no one turned up while got calls to shift the slot to 18th and then 28th which I refused. Finally amazon cancelled my installation and therefore, I got it installed from the same technician but had to pay 1000. Picture quality is amazing but sound is mind blowing and that too of q1. Non availability of Netflix is irritating. Rather than echo dot, amazon should have given fire stick free. Only con is remote, not very user friendly. Same remote can be used for fire stick if u wish to use it for Netflix or any other app. Few apps like ndtv or jio cinema which runs buttery smooth through fire stick, start buffering on Tv app. As I got 5k amazon cashback and 10% sbi card cashback, its a decent deal. Because of installation issue, I’m giving only 2 stars",Installation service is pathetic,B07W5QZQ45
"It was a steal Deal for me to buy this TV worth of 6998 in effective price of 55k in sale:- Got 5k Amazon pay balance. Got 2k instant discount with SBI credit card Additional Cashback of 5k in SBI credit card ( total 10% of cost - 2k instant discount) Also got Alexa echo dot free of cost 😁😁😁 Thanks AMAZON!! Review of Oneplus q1 tv:- Pros 1. Sound is premium quality. Crystal clear sound with beats with just 25% of the volume. On tuning volume to 50% it fills the complete living room and is UNBELIEVABLE. 2. Though they haven't mentioned the brightness level, the brightness is superb and colors are rich. Quality you can compare to other Samsung Qled models that come in 1.2laks. 3. TV design is bezieless and is premium from both front n backside. 4. Processing is smooth. Cons:- Main :- Refresh rate of tv is only 60Hrz which very basic. Any Qled in market even starts with 100Hrz. 1. Netflix is still not supported is still big set back. However it has been promised by OnePlus for support by next month. 2. There are still few glitches bugs in software for example when you try to login to premium in Sony live app then on OTP page keyboard doesn't come so you can't login. I have reported this to OnePlus. 3. HDMI ports are at the back so if tv is wall mounted then it's really difficult to reach out there to plug in and out something. 4. There are not much options to play with settings. For example to chance picture ratio or zoom in out etc no options are there. Similar is case with colors and contrast..not much options to play with..pretty standard thing given. 5. In Sound( type of sounds are very few standard, surround, clarity). 6. Serial no of tv is at the backside and not even inbuilt in the settings-about. Am I supposed to take out the tv if I have to tell the serial nbr to customer care...OnePlus...what were you thinking? Suggestions:- In case you are confused if to buy Q1 or Q1 pro, No need to invest extra 25k in OnePlus Q1 pro, since sound quality of Q1 itself is amazing. Overall feedback :- Overall am happy with my purchase and it feels value foroney. Of course it's not the best TV in Market, however it's premium thing in price range of normal one.",My OnePlus Q1 TV review,B07W5QZQ45

"I have always admired one plus brand. But of late, it is turning more in to a mix of samsung and apple in terms of their bad traits. However, let me see what I have assessed in last couple days of using it. 1. 4k quality is great. But then you get this quality even on a cheaper TV. It just depends on the durability. Will it last. 2. HD is also good . Delivers what you need. 3. SD, upscaling is little laboured. I have seen much better upscaled picture with a samsung led 60k as well as a TCL or bluankpunkt (hope i spelled it right) 30k tv. So little disappointed. 4. Sound is good for a smart tv. One of the few positives. 50 watts but on q1 it lacks the true base. Q1 pro could do better, but thats 30k more. Not worth. Can always get a home theatre under 5k. 5. In-built apps are crass. Useless. Heavy and doesnt respond properly. Prime video is the worst. It takes on an average 40 seconds to load. Can you believe it? On a 1GBps speed from spectra. Netflix not available. Some of the navigations do not work on some apps. 6. Used fire stick on the TV. Bad experience. Tacky. Doesnt load properly. Requires restart. Not a good experience. 7. Limited apps available via play store. 8. Chrome cast doesn't work full fledgedly. You can not take screen shots. Even though having that option. 9. Google assistance is a saving grace. 10. No motion sensing on remote. Even a 20k TV provides motion sensing mouse remote. In simpler terms airplay not available. 11. Remote is awesome in its aesthetics. But lacks a mute button. 12. There are no physical buttons on the tv. So take care of your remote. Remote gone. Game khalaas. Naa....use OnePlus connect on mobile. 13. Unfair to not give the stand with the tv. Wall mount is simple but gives less space between. 14. Android tv.takes long time to load and restart. Definitely NOT a 70k TV. Go for LG or a smasung at that rate. Personally have had great experience with smasung always. I chose this because Samsung frame TV was out of stock. That was my 1st choice. And inwas impulsive. But lets hope we have a great beast of a performance hidden here. Let oneplus provide some sensible updates and suddenly all the hardwares are used to its full potential.",MUST Read Review.

Installation team worthless. No idea about the device TV sliding soundbar not working Lodged n numbers of complaints with Amazon. No response from them Going to file case in consumer forum. Please don't buy,Poor service support,B07W5QZQ45
Writing this review after using for week. Picture quality is very ok with local cable SD channels. CRT TV do much better justice in picture quality. So if you are going to watch cable this is not right TV for you. Why are sound speakers behind?? Due to this sound output is very low. It doesn't seem like volume is from 8 speakers. Very inconvenient spot for cable connection and pendrive. It is very hard to insert pendrive for wall mounted TV. Who knows how to connect with Alexa? Definitely not echo support team .no steps mentioned anywhere. delivery guy was in so much hurry he didn't want to give demo on how to operate . It is bit difficult to figure it out specially as this was my first smart tv Editing the review after using tv for 2 weeks. Pendrive slot is not working so pendrive not detected. The 1+ service is worst no response after multiple follow up in 10 days .they just informed that the case is escalated and on highest priority but know one know when the technician will come. Not Amazon not one plus is ready to take responsibility for service. What's the use of 2years warrenty when you cannot provide warranty service within 15days? Didn't expect this bad service response from Amazon and one plus. Please take the tv back and refund the money.,Only hyped - zero star- one+ chor hai,B07W5QZQ45

"At this price, it’s an amazing TV.

Using it from last 6 days . Great experience picture quality is awesome .sound is clear and loud. Cons Less no of apps are available in playstore.need quick updates #oneplus,!!AWESOME 😊!!,B07W5QZQ45
"Before buying the TV, I checked many reviews by the so called experts. They all had great things to say about the TV with the only caveat being that the price seemed to be on a higher side . Hesitatingly (Because this was a new TV brought by ONePlus) I bought this TV and so far after a week of use, I don't have any complains or regrets. The quality of the TV is too good and has a premium look to it which you normally get in TVs with 100K+ price range. The Picture quality is awesome with many preset settings that can be amended by the user. But the best part of the TV is its sound system. Most TVs in the market have great Video quality but their sound system is so poor that one has to install a separate audio system with woofer to get a good viewing experience. With One Plus TV, we don't need any external sound bar. The Sound quality is awesome and provides a great viewing experience. The sound is loud, clear and versatile for different scenarios such as movies, sports, video games etc. The remote is uncomplicated with only limited buttons, but once you get used to it, it provides everything you need to navigate your way through. All in all, a great deal as far as I am concerned and I believe that OnePlus TV will provide tough competition to the established TV brands in the coming months.",A premium TV with Value for Money offering,B07W5QZQ45

"The One plus 55"" QLED TV is the excellent choice. The TV is best in terms of aesthetics, performance in both video and audio. The remote is cute and with USB c type charging which relieves from the pain of changing batteries. The picture quality is vibrant and and sound is very good Dolby digital and no need for any external speakers. This observations are made after 4 days of use. May be I will give additional feed back after a months usage. Me and my family are happy that we have made a right purchase. The wall mounting installation was done along with delivery within 45 minutes it was ready to use. Amazon did a great job.",Right Choice !,B07W5QZQ45
I had ordered my tv on the date of release and was shifting to a new home so could not open the box and check the tv. Today we installed the tv via Amazon installation service and there is a blue/green line on the left side of the screen and it disappears at times when I press the left bottom side of the tv. The installation person asked me to contact amazon. My return period is over and i am very much in trouble with my family now since they had asked me not to consider since the TV was new release from a new company. I am very much not able to answer them and my father is not happy to service a brand new tv. I am a very hard core OnePlus user(from OnePlus one) and i am very much sad about this incident. I request fellow community members to share their opinion and request some help from OnePlus if possible. Update 31Oct: I have received the replacement TV from amazon.in and the new tv is all good. A big thanks to OnePlus and amazon for helping out and keeping in touch in every way possible. The customer care was super helpful and friendly.,Tv screen is not working. Update- replacement new tv sent,B07W5QZQ45
"The 55 inch QLED one plus tv comes in as a complete surprise in this category. The 4K ultra HD display along with 50 watts output, sub woofers and full range speakers gives an ultimate theater experience of theater at home. It has a hassle free setup process from delivery, installation and technical setup. It was delivered with couple of days of ordering. The installation was done on spot by delivery guys. The setup was very easy to follow. Just fire up the tv and you will be guided through the process to sync it to inbuilt wifi, syncing in youtube account and more. It's perfectly compatible with Google home and Alexa. We have both and we have tested the same. The remote which comes along the TV is also quite impressive with it's sleek silver design. It operates on USB charging instead of regular remote batteries which is definitely a plus. It has an inbuilt button of Google assistant, you can speak into the mic in the remote to control your tv. Cons: Waiting for the Netflix support. Doesn't come with a table top stand. Remote is very slippery.",My first Smart TV,B07W5QZQ45
"I am writing this review after using the product for a month now. Being a movie fan, I watch a lot of movies and a good tv is what I have always bought with latest technology. I have an LG OLED with me but I will not compare the both as there is a substantial price difference. Now coming to the Much awaited and hyped One Plus TV. The most important things in a TV now a days are:- PROS: 1. Picture Quality and Pixel Enhancer: The picture quality of this one plus TV at this price is reasonable good. Not as good as Samsung QLED but almost at par. If Samsung QLED picture quality is 100, then one plus QLED is 90. Picture enhancer is also good. As compared to a 4K TV, picture quality is worth the money. So * for this. 2. Sound; is good and loud but there is an echo in the sound. But again this is not a home theatre and for a TVat this price this is superb. So again a * for this. CONS: 1. Refreshing Rate; This is where this TV is not at all worth buying. The refreshing rate is only 60Hz whereas most of the QLED TV are 120Hz. Most of us will think that this is not an important feature but you can not watch anything if the refreshing rate is not good. What happens is that the movie and sound lags. For example there is a 10 seconds actual video clip. If you will watch this clip in your other TV or Mobile or laptop, each second will be played in exact one second. In one plus TV, because the refreshing rate is slow, what happens is actual 5 seconds are stretched to 7 seconds and the latter 5 seconds are played in 3 seconds. So basically at times the movie becomes fast and at times the movie becomes slow and gives you a pathetic movie watching experience and this happ na on continuous basis. So crux is, it’s a pathetic experience watching anything on this Tv. 2. Installation: Amazon home services have provide one of the worst installation service. No kidding. Verdict: because of slow refreshing rate, I would not recommend this TV at all. Go for a simple 4K smart TV or wait till next Diwali till Samsung reduces their prices of QLED which is going to happen.",SAD TV,B07W5QZQ45
"One word. Waaaaw!!! Just when delivered and out of the box, it was just taking me out of the world. It's an amazing creation. Just left stunned... All are positives.. No words to explain. Nothing negative I can see. Oooh OnePlus hats off to your Research & Development team. I am looking forward to see the futuristic products that will stun the world and it's not far away. Keep inventing and make us stunned. All the best!!!!",Brilliant creation and stage set to gear up for all TV manufacturers!!!,B07W5QZQ45
"I'm about to tell a story, so get yourself a bucket of popcorn. I being a fan of one plus phones, bought the TV within very first hour of launch. Received the TV without having any Idea of craziness this TV bought with itself. First the technician installed it tilted and when I reached out to complain about it, Amazon agent said One plus does installation while One Plus agent said that Amazon did installation. Later while getting swung between Amazon and One Plus installation fiesta I realised that TV panel was badly bleeding patchy white lights on top left corner. I quickly borrowed few eyes to confirm it wasn't just happening to me. Later I called in amazon to report and Pheww it was tough getting through to get amazon agent on call once I have touched ""return and replacement"" button. Call would either end abruptly or technical issues would happen just for that call(well verified) or agent couldn't find my order number. Finally I tricked a call through and somehow convinced for inspection visit. It was cool after that as technician on visit agreed about issue and approved exchange. 2nd TV arrived and not so surprisingly it was tilted at same degree in opposite direction this time and technician won the argument by huge support from other 2 helpers he brought along. Anyway main issue came as I realised all images being blurred on top edge of the element (text ot picture on screen) while they remain sharp on horizontal edges. This time I had to take pictures on phone and explain it in email(it's tough). The agent finally agreed but would only provide refund instead of replacement. Now, I might have been sickened and raged by these repeating quality issues but was spoiled by color production and gorgeous looks of this TV at the same time. Thus I wanted to get same TV without any panel issues(funny, eh?). Conclusion (seriously):: Yeah, It might sound like an exceptional case but it confirms the theory how one plus has jeopardized the quality control in rush to launch the TV. Also that services have been affected badly from beginning itself because of confusion between amazon and one plus to reach out in case service is needed. I'm left with 8 holes in the wall and 3k worth hole in wallet as bank won't settle EMI interests of 3k due to cashback deduction from refund money. Now as I contacted One plus they chose not to reply back. ***** Stay Away from this TV for now******","Bought it, returned it Twice nd I'm left with 8 holes in wall.",B07W5QZQ45
Tv Picture suddenly goes into Pink.. U can see in the video and pics attached below.. We need to restart the tv to get it back to normal amd after sometime it will again to pink Blacks are not deep black always.. Inbuilt picture modes are not calibrated well.. Cinema home mode is some what better Sound quality is not good.. No proper bass coming from speakers.. Inbuilt sound modes are only 2 and those are not good.. We have to select user mode and set all frequencies to maximum to get better output THE BIGGEST SOUND PROBLEM IS SPEAKERS IS GETTING AIR NOISE FROM SPEAKERS If we set volume below 5 we can hear air noise very clearly even in 10 to 15 volume also air noise is there Connect app frequently disconnectes with tv.. Much hyped Gamma magic function is not magical at all SD channels are not good to watch on this TV Overall Disappointed with OnePlus TV Q1 model Returned tv and got replacement but same problems repeated in replacement tv also.. Returned this one also and waiting for refund,Disappointed With Picture and Sound Quality,B07W5QZQ45
"Please find photographs of tv in which you can find a vertical line left side of screen. This was found at the time of installing only and the person suggested to wait and it will disappear in some days. But I am finding the same problem and the line is not going. The installation person told that if there problem persists, the tv will be replaced with new one. In addition the color is turning into pink all of a sudden and because of that the real colors are appearing in different colors. If the tv is to be replaced please do the needful. All accessories of product are available with me and the same will be handed over at the time of replace. I hope to hear from your end as early as possible.","Replacement of product, picture quality",B07W5QZQ45

"Great product. TV Quality is superb. It is a metal frame and QLED TV. Because of QLED picture is good compaired to normal LED. Blacks are deep and colout representation is also good. This increases picture viewing experience especially while watch films. Normal TV channels do not pixelate and can have a fluid viewing experience because of the inbuild settings. You can access these setting from the android setting menu, picture settings like MEMC, etc. Sound Quality is also great even with non Pro model. Packaging is very premium as expected from Oneplus.

TV deilvery at no issue but installation process is so slow that its has scheduled on 4th oct but till date note done and now saying toh again schedule for installation no help from amazon customer care neither from Oneplus (Oneplus refuse for the job said it's amazon look out not our so you will get the call from amazon) I will return the product if it's not installed by the day end or any solution to me.,Delayed installation,B07W5QZQ45
"1. It is funny that 1+ send stand seperately. One has to wait for many days to get TV installed. For me it was lying packed. 2. Very poor coordination between Amazon and vcare if installation. You will run post to pillar. 3. Coming to TV, SW hangs every now and then. Unstabkr OS. 4. Red color does not cime as red, it is akwasy pink. Tried all possible settings. Called OnePlus and they refuse to entertain. They say call Amazon. Amazon will send someone only after my return period expires so that I will not be able to return. What a trap. 5. Avoid buying as there is nothing extraordinary about it at a price if 60K.","Pathetic service, waste of money. Avoid buying.",B07W5QZQ45
"Picture and sound quality of the TV are very impressive. However, there are few glitches in the software that should be resolved: - The TV restarts automatically when WiFi network changes. - Video on the TV lags when mirroring form Oneplus 6T. - Cannot connect iPhone to Bluetooth stereo. - Video quality of amazon prime video cannot be changed, which results to very high data usage.

Writing this review after calling atleast dozen times to the one plus and amazon because the picture quality is really bad . whether it is SD or HD . Really bad Product by one + and surprisingly one+ has nothing to do with the service or compalins because amazon is totally responsible for the everything after sales what I have told by the customer care of one plus. There is no window for return the product. When I booked a complaint for the product the guy came for the service who don't even know how to operate a smart TV because he is employee of amazon . Now I stuck.,Very bad experience by Amazon as well as one plus6,B07W5QZQ45
"1.First of all Customer care for One plus Television are not available. Installation people dont know much about the product. 2. Most of the channels are in SD, SD quality is very very poor dont even compare with small company 4k TV also. One plus have to take this issue very much seriously and resolve it. 3.Extra charging for stand is not good, its like a business oriented. 4. Movie videos running very slow when compared with my old LED TV and picture quality also not good 5.TV is not worth as they promised and not recommended to others too","Poor Pic Clarity, not value for money",B07W5QZQ45
"I bought this TV a couple of weeks back. key things to focus on: 1) its a QLED and not OLED, and QLED has nothing similar to OLED, it's more like LCD interms of how the display is managed. 2) Over all packaging is great like cellphone packaging very neat and structured. 3) Getting TV to setup is easy but getting it installed is a challenge, it took me 2 weeks to just get it installed. 4) 2 star rating because the remote already stopped working , electronic devices it happens but the bigger issue is there is no support framework available to address this issue, one plus guys send you to Amazon support, regular amazon support sends you to Amazon special support, amazon special support asks you to talk to one plus and one plus again tells you to go talk to Amazon.Now stuck with a new TV whose remote does not work. Cellphone remote is a lifesaver but a non starter for my parents. 5) Decent sound quality, I have it hooked up with my Bose sound bar 6) No support for Netflix is a big negative 7) dedicated amazon prime button on remote is big plus for someone like me who uses prime a lot. Over all a good buy but no point buying it when it cannot be supported well.",One plus launched great tv but fails to launch equally good support for it.,B07W5QZQ45

"Finally got today, it's just incredible 😍.. Fully featured smart TV which is priced at almost Rs69000 (for Q1), I also seen other companies selling their QLED TV's at Rs1,25,000-1,50,000... This is ultimately the best in budget QLED TV Feeling very great full for the product and expecting for the company to come up with more products at aggressive prices👍 Thnxx to #oneplus ❤️",Display & Sound Quality is Amazing...

"Master piece product.. Just go for it. My Reviews after 15 days of use. Pros. 1. Almost Bezel less screen . 2. Amazing picture quality only in HD channels ofcourse. SD channels looks average. 3. Supports Prime, Jio cinema app, HotStart, Zee tv and many more apps which you need to have subscription. 4.Super sleek Design fits in wall very well. 5. Dolby Atmos sounds excellent. 6. Clean UI of Oxygen. Cons Now these are my personal experience which may vary by user. 1. Very Sleek remote so one should be very careful while using it. Don't ever give it to small kids or small children else be ready to shell out more money if remote is damaged. Just to be safe i have got a sillcon cover for remote which is of apple tv , which will help protecting the remote for accidental fall and damage. 2. Being a sleek tv has very less or nill space from wall to tv, so please plan to install all cables n USB devices before you wall mount the TV. 3. OnePlus has to provide more with next models. a. Must Table Stand b. Remote cover preferably sillcon one. c. Remote should have a mute button , else elders will find it a big big miss and it's true as that's must from a usage point. Anyone want to buy a sillcon cover check out for Apple tv remote cover , which fits perfectly with OnePlus tv remote.",Must buy.. if you have really like one plus products.,B07W5QZQ45
"Pros: - Sound system has treble & have a different feel. - Slim and slick design of both TV and Remote. - Latest TV OS. - Hardware wise it's durable and designed for Indian terrain. Cons: - TV screen is reflective, which you should notice if you pay that much. - Sound system should have been better. I know I said it has good treble, but for some content it is a disadvantage. - Remote should have a power on/off button, mute button.",Great but Improvement Needed,B07W5QZQ45
"This review is after one day of usage! Bought this tv by trusting the brand which produces premium android phones and somewhere i was little bit worried ! But after using this trust me go for it!! Delivery was fast, Installation was hassle free and the tv got Installed at the time of delivery itself. Thanks to amazon and oneplus! Seriously it produced the best picture quality ever and the sound output was amazing!! I was just lost in it !! trust me i felt goosebumps while watching the videos in YouTube and prime video ! Just ensure you have a fast internet connectivity! Mine is 25 mbps nd it plays 4k in youtube and ultra hd in prime!! I am really thankful to oneplus and amazon for providing the best premium tv ever!! Guys its qled with dolby vision , dolby atmos and produces 50watt sound for just 70k seriously who does provide this!!!? All These years other tv manufacturers were literally looting us but now its Oneplus tv era(just like life after jio) hoping other manufacturers also make our money worth! Its like a fluid!! Very fast and smooth ! The only con i felt is that theres no button for settings (to tune picture settings and sound settings)on the remote and badly waiting for Netflix ! Just go with this and if u want to experience it before buying go to oneplus stores they r really welcoming nd helpful! And also if u have enough budget go for pro version but this one is no less than taht! Just wondering how the pro version produces sound when the non pro version itself is a BEAST!! One plus 😘 Just hoping that this would run without any problems and will last for a long!! Anyways its providing 2 years warranty its enough to trust this for some extent!!",AMAZING!! Worth every rupee!!,B07W5QZQ45
Don't buy this product from Amazon. My remote is not working and Amazonnis making us run piller to post. Amazon asked us to contact OnePlus and when we called OnePlus we are asked to contact Amazon. Today 16 calls between amazon and oneplus till not no resolution. Amazon wants us to open ticket on their app which is not working. Now we have no choice to sit and wait till amazon fixes its issues.

"One of the Best displays i have seen till day.. Have been using LED display for the past 4 Yr and always had challenges w.r.t Clarity and Light Adjustments, these issue is handled automatically. The only concer is the Sound , while the TV has 8 Speakers, i dont see the effect of the same, I am thinking of having my BOSE audio system reconnected. Other then Cripsness of Sound (used to on account of using a BOSE AUDIO SYSTEM), the TV is a GOOD Offer,.. Would surely recommend the same. NOTE: One more Hrudle i faced was,, since my TV was one of the initial Piece, the Installation guy had no clue on its Operations and i ended up doing R&D to find out the Functioanlity of each feature.",A Theater screen @ Home,B07W5QZQ45
"Well won't talk tooany technicalities as I am sure those who are willing to buy this piece of art must have browsed the YouTube like anything for the reviews. Of course with that said this is my first ever smart/Android (call it whatever you wish to) TV and I felt it was a great purchase. The instalation date was too late for my liking so after confirming with Amazon that if I open the box and the TV unit appeared damaged in transit I am entitled for replacement, however if there are issues related to the TV OS in that scenario the warranty would be applicable and not the replacement, then it's up to One plus to decide whether to replace or repair the unit. If you are going to do the installation on your own make absolutely sure and I say it again be absolutely sure you would be able to do it, else be kind to yourself and have patience for the technician guy to do the tedious job. The set up part should be easy, considering its an Android TV and the set up is similar to setting up your Android phone. The delivery guy while delivering the TV complimented saying sir you won't need to go to a cinema hall after this, and trust me when I switched on the Tele, it literally have me a cinema experience, the sound output is stunning. Yes as rightly pointed by several other people adjusting the Televisions display is a task but u should be able to do it as per your preference. All the apps work as charm, I am only a prime user so am happy with whatever apps are on the television. The HD channels are upscaled and look stunning add to that the crystal clear loud output soothes your ears.

"I ordered this product on 2nd October 2019 and got it delivered & installed on 4th October by Oneplus authorised technician. I got amazing offers and the net price for the TV was only Rs 58000/-. (Rs 2000 instant discount by SBI + Rs 5000 cash back from SBI and Rs 5000 Amazon Pay Credit). If this was not enough I got a Amazon Alexa Echo Dot free from Cloudtail seller. The TV is worth every single pie you spent. I saw few other products like Sony, Samsung and TV which are almost double the price for this quality. No regrets buying this TV.

"Oneplus has assembled a good display, sound system and Android OS into a TV with a decent price tag. But the TV doesn't perform. The 4K upscaling is pathetic. Amazon Prime App is pathetic. Playing Full HD, HDR and Dolby vision content in this TV is a headache. The 4K up-scaling is too bad that even high quality full HD movies (played through HDD) are highly pixelated. When HDR content is played through Amazon App (No Netflix support as of now) the brightness levels fluctuates hysterically. In Dolby vision movies (played through HDD) video keeps flickering. The digital audio output settings are also weird. In digital audio pass through mode, no audio output is obtained through ARC. Curious to know why Oneplus has come-out with such a half baked product in a big market like India? Most of these issues are software isssues which requires quite a lot R&D. Sony buys LED panels from LG, and Sony's picture quality is better than LG's because of better software optimization. Don't think a novice like OnePlus will be able to do that, unless a proper R&D team is setup for this. Wait and watch for the next software update.",Half baked product from Oneplus,B07W5QZQ45

Sound is okay and loud but, not a great factor to buy as they mentioned in the event (about Q1 model only). the software needs to be improved (Got 1 update on 29 OCT). Ultra-smooth motion is not accurate (Poor DTH SD performance) Ram is Okay with 3GB but Storage is only 8GB free after OS usage out of16 GB Summary: The main factor to buy this Tv is display, we don't have QLED TVs at this price range in India.

"Picture is un-naturally vivid and the colors seem un-naturally bright and sunny. Not only is there no Netflix app. casting Netflix via built-in Chromecast or airstream doesn't work either. Had to deploy an external chromecast. Sound quality is pretty good but not sure if it is significantly better than the cheaper model of OnePlusTV at 70k. Practically paid 30k or so extra for the stand, an echo for free, 5k cashback and some extra speakers that slide down when you turn on the TV.

One thing missing is Netflix, may be next update we might get it. I bought 1+ Q1 55 TV.

Removed all the bits of dust and clutter before leaving. Picture and sound quality is good. The TV setup process a simple, just like setting up a smart phone for the first time. Remote is sleek. The volume buttons are on the side and almost flushed with the thin body. Need sometime to get used to it. Also it gets lost frequently, being so thin and small. There is no mute button, so you will have to reduce the volume all the way to zero. The remote is quite responsive though. All is perfect, except few things which I did not like. Hence given 4 stars. 1. The TV boots up to a Home Screen where you have to select Live TV or other stuff like Amazon prime or YouTube etc. This happens every time you switch ON. I have a DTH set top box connected to the TV HDMI, but it does not start directly to the STB channels. This is annoying. Earlier TV was booting directly to the STB channels and when I wanted the smart TV features, I used the remote. The switching ON and watching the STB channels is a ritual that takes 8 to 10 seconds each time for the OnePlus TV. 2. When anyone tries to connect a bluetooth device, like headphone, the screen goes to the pairing options display. This happens even if a neighbor is trying to set up something in his home. You have to cancel his request, then navigate back to the channel you were watching. But if the other person re-sends the pairing request, the whole process has to be repeated again. Very annoying especially if you are watching something interesting, live match etc. There should be an option to bypass this. 3. The connection ports like USB, HDMI are located behind the TV in such a manner that it is nearly impossible to attach or detach any cable or USB drive with the TV mounted on the wall. You will have to remove it from the bracket, then settle the cable connections or USB drive and mount it back. The dismounting and mounting is easy but the TV is big so you need at least 2 adults and handle very carefully. I have procured the table mounting stand separately, but will use it sometime later. If these things do not bother you, then it is a good choice and can go for it.",Good choice,B07W5QZQ45
See the vertical black line coming after less than 3 week of usage... It's experience like old crt based television where magnetic impacts on screen... Are this coming from past technology.. Let's see what OnePlus say about it... Booked service call.. waiting for come and replace entire tv.. bur not sure this will again happened.. Will update you guys...,Vertical visible broad black line on screen,B07W5QZQ45
"1. Delivery and installation happened on the same day without any issues. 2. Sound quality is really amazing, I really liked it. I don't think we need to go for the pro version just for an additional soundbar. 3. Picture quality is not bad but you can't compare with Sony Bravia. 4. Remote is very comfortable to handle it but it will be good to add at least the mute button in the upcoming release. 5. Opening Apps takes more time even in 100Mbps speed, so software quality needs to be checked and updated. 6. Got cashback of 5k immediately using HDFC debit card, its a good deal.",Overall good product and good deal,B07W5QZQ45
"Here in India all brands having stand as well as wall hanging but One plus have only wall mounting. If we need stand which is very costly. It s very difficult to agree with you. Currently I am staying a rented apartment which is not very suitable for wall mounting. Moreover for changing of cable everytime we need to remove wall mounting for action. It is very difficult. Moreover just one month is nearing. So can not update my comlete opinion. Secondly since this is a new TV in the market, company should provide technical assistant. But here no such arrangements provide by Amazon. One more noticeable point is your remote not up-to the mark. Your handbook also not providing any technical details. Due to this we are expecting assistant from your side",One plus TV review,B07W5QZQ45
I have been using one plus 7 mobile and with mobile quality in mind I thought of buying the tv as well. But unfortunately the tv is nowhere near the hype created for the product. At the cost of buying to picture quality delivered is pathetic. At close to 1Lakh tv I could have bought Sony TV with sound bar! Suggest not to buy it's just waste of money.,Waste of money,B07W5QZQ45
1) Awesome sound quality. Mind blowing. I have never experienced such deep bass from any flat TVs ever 2) Picture quality is decent. Images are a little over saturated. 3) Interface is good and easy to navigate. 4) Remote is sleek. Not so user friendly I feel. 5) Amazon delivery was fast and installation done as promised without much hazzle.,Great package overall,B07W5QZQ45
"I got this product on 16th of October, I was excited about the product, but it didn’t last for couple of days. I noticed that, the audio is getting cut for 2 seconds for every 2:20 seconds. So I have raised a request for Technician to look into the issue. The technician didn’t turn up as per the schedule. After making several calls, the technician said he will come to my home. After sometime I received a sms saying the customer wants to reschedule. The service seems to be worst and waiting for a resolution.",Worst experience,B07W5QZQ45
"Went to the store to check out the TV. Am buying 4. Sales staff is very rude and not upto the mark. If this is the case, wondering what the after sales support is going to be. Will definitely not buy this product if the experience with their own brand store is so bad. Not worth it.",Really bad sales experience,B07W5QZQ45
TV is awesome,Superb,B07W5QZQ45
Worst purchase ever .. never buy such a tv from amazon. TV screen went bad in 20 days and am following for an engineer to visit for the last 20 days. The whole system is broken,"Worst purchase decision of my life, torture by Amazon",B07W5QZQ45
"Remote looks very good in pics but in reality it's like a 10cm scale thin one...Volume control is big challenge..everytime with Google opt only..but it's good that its rechargeable one. TV picture Quality and sound quality are awsome with HD videos..but don't expect to see the SD channels. (USB port is not as expected..everytime we have to plug in n out to detect, there is no option to find the USB - This issue fixed with s/w updates ), but Its taking long time to detect and there is no backward n forward optn. It would have been good if One+ having table top stand or wall mount with movable one. It has only fixed wall mount which is no space to use if there is any switchboard at backside wall. Very careful needed on screen and remote. If small kids at home don't expect it for long run..so Overall I can give 4star",Good one..Go for it,B07W5QZQ45
"Best product enjoying watching,easy to use ,handy remote with minimal buttons & maximum use , perfect installation by the team on time delivery.",Loved shopping online,B07W5QZQ45
We are happy with this tv... Enjoying quality and sound,One plus tv is awesome,B07W5QZQ45
Excellent product in this price range and very good picture quality but even though sound put to zero level small humming sound coming from speakers. Features are very good and excellent remote design but there is no mute button on remote which is great drawback for this product. One more excellent feature I liked very much is by placing or covering the power light TV switches ON as well as OFF. In warranty card 12 months warranty mentioned but who ever purchased it before 25 Oct they get additional one more year warranty how can we claim this additional warranty? .Overall it's very good product from one Plus brand.,Excellent product,B07W5QZQ45
I just got it for 59K on Diwali sale and i would say after two weeks usage its premium and worth for money in all the way!! Thanks Amazon for delivered it without damage and OnePlus for this great made!,Premium Meets Elegance !,B07W5QZQ45
Have been having this display issue since day 1 of installation. Still have not got the TV replaced / returned although have opted. The third party service visited and agreed product was defective. But no sign of replacement till now.,Poor customer service,B07W5QZQ45

Overall Awesome TV. ---------++++---------- ***** Picture Quality is Excellent. 😍 ***** Very clear and quality sound. Sound bar or home theatre may not required.🥇 ****Connective could have been better. *****We love the remote style and appreciate the idea of charging. 🏆 *OnePlus should review the wallmounting kid as there is no space after installation between tv and wall. ✂️,Awesome Qled TV,B07W5QZQ45
Pixel quality is poor as compared to other modern TVs. Also limited apps can be downloaded. Doesn’t support Netflix. Not an impressive product.,One Plus TV 55 inches,B07W5QZQ45
"This is the best TV under 70000 Rs. Picture Quality is very good... you can see in the picture no.3, it's Pehli Dafa song... it was playing in 480p but it picture was so clear... And Sound quality is also good... I was watching Aquaman and felt like I was in the theatre... Trust me... Don't buy any other TV if you're planning to buy a new TV and your budget is 70k.",Value for Money,B07W5QZQ45
Using since one almost month and below are the thoughts : HDMI ARC not working with my Sony home theater HTR3 Works only with optical cable Speakers starts making noise after 40 level ... Doesn't give direct TV option...someone who is not tech savvy then this TV is not advisable No mute button on the remote and quite complex to operate remote as well Takes lot of time to connect to internet/wifi,Decent TV ... not a wow,B07W5QZQ45
"Amazing product for the price.The 4k clarity is very good and the remote is very sleek and stylish. The TV has built in Google alexa which can play music, videos and switch off the TV. Worth the money that you pay!!",Awesome product!!!,B07W5QZQ45
"I had choice to buy Sony, Samsung in same budget, but when I compared OnePlus features with Sony and Samsung they were far away. However Sony/Samsung is providing such advance features in their high budget Television. If you are looking for android,QLED,Big screen, good sound and picture quality and having budget constrain then go for OnePlus Tv.",Happy to have OnePlus TV,B07W5QZQ45
"Happy with the TV, but improvement in software required(Bugs are there), Netflix not available in Oneplus TV. In Firestick remote, when set to Oneplus TV, on/off and volume button not working in this remote. Oneplus TV not listed in list of TVs for setting Firestick TV for this remote. In wall mount, ports are not accessible easily",First encounter with Oneplus TV,B07W5QZQ45
Amazing TV at this price point and what else we can expect when we get great offers from AMAZON. True motion is something you need to toggle when you watch sports and movies. But that's the feature of TV. Very much satisfied by the product from ONE plus. Flagship killer . Thank you one plus.,Great Tv,B07W5QZQ45
Please go for Q1 don't buy Q1pro . difference is only sliding soundbar only worst audio quality.please buy Q1 onlyml.,Don't buy Q1pro,B07W5QZQ45
"Fist of all the picture and sound quality of the TV of good, but The TV which I received got some issues, 1st TV's display got 15 to 20 nonworking pixels due to this TV shows black dots in every content, also in some frames, I can see whit sports on the black screen, I did call Amazon support team after a lot of calls that somehow agreed but still they did not confirm the replacement of my TV, they asked 72 hours to get confirmation from upper management, so I am wating for their response, hope they will replace it, otherwise I need to go to consumer forum, Also, I need to say that Amazon's delivery team and installation guy didn't handle TV properly, as TV should be unboxed from bottom side but they remove the TV from upper side of the box also single guy removed it which can damage the tv easily, I think that is why the white spots are coming on the display, also installation guy did not given the demo of the TV and he told me that someone from their team will come and provide the demo but they just close the installation process without any demo. I will update the review if my tv got replaced by amazon.",Some pixel not working,B07W5QZQ45
"Nice tv, it's Qled picture quality is awesome, speakers are with extra bass compared to MI tv & Samsung tv it's 4 times better. This type picture quality you'll get in Samsung Qled in more than ₹1.2lac. C type Charging remote. Free installation with free wallmount stand or table top stand (you can choose only one type of stand free)",Wonderful product,B07W5QZQ45
"Seriously this is the TV for the price range from 50 to 70k budget, don't go for Pro model, instead of that Q1 was better and could buy a 5.1ch soundbar,and undoubtedly this TV is a best value for money and the picture, audio experience was great....",One plus Q1 Premium TV At a Budget Price,B07W5QZQ45
Worth the money spent.,Amazing 😍,B07W5QZQ45
"Im Always using oneplus products and satisfied with the product quality, same satisfaction is thr in TV too but for only sound bar not given in Q1 and for Q1 pro 20k more this pricing is not worth",Good!! Loved it,B07W5QZQ45
If you are looking to get a TV installed and get a great viewing experience as well as customise the viewing experience then this is the TV. However you will need to keep meddling the settings and keep expecting updates and fixes from OnePlus to get to the top viewing experience. In top brands that's not the case.,Not for the faint hearted,B07W5QZQ45
"Picture and sound is great but if you go deeper you could clearly see theres no good picture upscaling which makes 720p look terrible here. You can watch 1080p, its great in bright scenes but some dark scenes just look bad! The are choppy and look like 240p content. 4k is great theres no complain here. They might give updates to improve it but lets see. Similarly the sound is great but theres a catch. The bass is not always great. Sometimes or just on bass frequency maybe won't play like others. Its almost like beating the speakers with something. But its only with high bass content otherwise its great. The software isnt that optimized so you might see some glitches here wnd there. And i faced some connectivity issues maybe its just me. Overall its a nice tv but could have been better at this price!",Great but not best for its price.,B07W5QZQ45
Packing and delivery was excellent. But the installation got delayed by a week due to the installation guys. Picture and sound quality is awesome. Very elegant and neat finish of the nearly bezel less tv. Android tv does not have any lag.,But Costly but worth a buy,B07W5QZQ45
My one plus TV heating up in lower portion since very first day. Complaint to customer care but waiting since last 20 days for replacement.,Heating up issue,B07W5QZQ45

"There is no proper support from either amazon or one plus. Amazon delivered the TV but demo still pending since last 14 days as on 14-Oct-2019. Further to add amazon technical team has very limited knowledge about this product,while I approached the amazon technical team for configuring echo dot with this TV I was asked to refer youtube videos..as well one plus team not aware of same.",product support and poor service quality from Amazon with respect to installation and demo.,B07W5QZQ45
"First I would like to congratulate Amazon for the prompt delivery and excellent packing. Installation was done immediately. The engineer came along with TV. Within half an hour they have completed installation. Only drawback was that there is no stand for the TV. It is only wall mount. Coming to quality, it is awesome, outstanding. You can add many more adjectives. There is no Netflix installed with TV. All other apps are pre-installed. The remote is really cute and easy to operate and it is chargeable. You have Google Assistant and Prime TV in the Remote. Just like computer, you can make the TV in sleep mode, restart and shut down. You have pre-installed screen savers. It the best bargain for 62000 (2000 sbi and 5000 Amazon pay).","It is excellent, outstanding and Mind blowing.",B07W5QZQ45
"This TV has Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision support making it foolproof for the future. The Picture quality is awesome for 4K and HD Content. Pictures for SD Content are a bit washed out. Since, I am using it along with my 5.1Ch Home Theatre unable to comment on its sound quality. Remote control needs to be improved, A few more buttons could have been added.",A foolproof TV for the future !,B07W5QZQ45
"Great picture Quality, vivid colours. Good product Oneplus team, Congrats!! For those of you who are complaining on the upscaling, suggest you reduce ""Soap opera effect"" by turning of ultra smooth motion, which makes the movie look like behind the scenes. Please add mute, swipe left & right on the oneplus connect to forward/backward videos . It's more convenient that way!!",Beautiful picture quality!,B07W5QZQ45

"Received broken screen, Installation person open to install TV. When he start TV, found screen is damage on left corner. And Stipe in horizontal direction.

After 30 hour no one going to install. Don't know when going to install. 10 days replacement policy.... May be install after 10 days.....so can't replace if any problem found.... Very bad experience.

"Overpriced, but OK. 4k content picture clarity is good, sound quality is good, no sound bars required, bazel less design good Cons, need to be improved 1)Missing mute button in remote, don't know why one plus missed this, mute works only with alexa, very limited buttons in remote 2)OS slow, multiple clicks required to turn off tv 3)No Browser, no Netflix 4)Complex operating for old people.

"Very good TV. Excellent picture quality and sound clarity. However, I had expected better bass performance as it includes 2 sub-woofers. Netflix is still not added.

This is an amazing product with very less price. Speakers are good. one plus pro has 8 speakers while this one has 4. It was difficult to go to showroom but since it was oneplus we took pain to go there and we were astonished to see outstanding picture quality. Generally oled TVs are 1lakh + rupees.

Using this TV since a month. Picture quality from HD feed or YouTube/Amazon prime is excellent. SD channels viewing experience is acceptable.

So not using the speakers when viewing dish channels,Pretty good TV but slightly overpriced,B07W5QZQ45

"The OnePlus TV is a 55"" 4K QLED TV that comes with Android TV OS. It has 3GB Ram and 16Gb Internal Storage. I have the Q1 Pro variant with me. The display and Sound quality are amazing. The sliding out speakers with the glowing LED is an absolute delight and something new. I have been using the TV from the launch time and here are my observations. -------------- ⏩⏩ Pros: -------------- 👍 4K QLED display is amazing. The color pop out and the Blacks are deep giving a great viewing experience. The screen is bright and the option to control back light is useful. 👍 Dolby Vision, HDR10 and HDR10+ support for watching selected content in High dynamic range. This helps a lot in improving the viewing experience. 👍 Dolby Atmos support for improved audio quality. 👍 Minimal bezels for immersive viewing experience. 👍 Has many Input ports for multi-utility. 4 HDMI 2.0 ports, 1 Ethernet, 1 USB 3.0, 1 USB 2.0, 1 Optical, 1 AV and 1 RF. One of the HDMI supports ARC. 👍 The 50W speaker is loud and clear. Front firing gives a better audio experience. 30-40% volume is sufficient for a large room. The LED lighting and sliding out feature is surely an attraction. With bluetooth stereo, the LED on the speaker even blinks with the music like a visualizer. 👍 Android TV OS. This provides access to tons of Apps and games. The software updates are promised by OnePlus for 3 years. Already got an update that improved the HDR performance. 👍 Connect App for controlling TV from the Phone. Useful for multitasking. 👍 Chromecast Built-in. So you can easily cast videos, photos and other media with a click. No need to connect every time. 👍 Screen mirroring is supported and works smoothly. 👍 The remote can be recharged by a regular charger. No need for AA/AAA batteries. 👍 Bluetooth connectivity. 50 W speakers can be used as Bluetooth Speakers with the Stereo Option or you can connect a Bluetooth headphone to listen in isolation. 👍 TV can be controlled by Google Assistant and Alexa enables devices. -------------- ⏩⏩ Cons: -------------- 👎 The Software needs some improvement and hopefully it will be improved in time. 👎 The native video player needs improvement as it struggles to play some video file formats. 👎 HDR optimization needs improvement in regards to colors. 👎 The remote though looks super sleek and trendy, it's not a practical approach. No Mute button and changing 👎 TV channels is a hassle by navigation keypads. So not Elderly friendly. 👎 The Table top stand is not stable. It wobbles even with a small touch. 👎 The extra price for the Q1 Pro variant. 👎 No 3.5mm Port. 👎 Control options with Google Assistant and Alexa to be increased. --------------------- ⏩⏩ Conclusion: --------------------- If you are looking for a TV with QLED 4K Display and Android TV OS, then OnePlus TV is a good option to choose, provided you go for the Q1 variant. As this is the first product in TV segment for the brand, the service might need some time to establish well.",Great Option for People who want a QLED 4K TV| Read before you buy 📺🤩,B07W5QZQ45

Not working properly bad picture quality we can buy it for 3k is high,Overall,B07W5QZQ45
"The guy who came for installing TV seems to be a novice. He is not aware of optic cable The issue is that the inbuilt apps is not transmitting sound thru my Onkyo home theatre sys Kindly send an experienced technician to sort the issue. And also replacement policy by Amazon is skewed in the sense that its deliberately made very very cumbersome. First you have to call Amazon customer support staff, the wait time for which is invariably 15-20 mins. Then you need to tell him or her the reasons for seeking replacement which they will not agree to most of the times. SO I will be very very skeptical in buying anything from Amazon going forward",Inbuilt Apps including USB drive not transmitting sound through Amplifier,B07W5QZQ45
Product quality can be defined only when it gets installed. No care for installation of the product very poor services. Already logged complaint also rescheduled the appointment but still no response from installation team,Poor services,B07W5QZQ45
Lot of flaws in the TV.. Like no Netflix no browser mobile screen share problem... 70 k for what?Only display? Samsung q led 55 inch with all features offering 80 k that too is a brand.. Can't find any outstanding features to shift to oneplus,Not worthy,B07W5QZQ45
"I bought this TV from somewhere and asking myself these questions. Ask yourself. 99k for what? - Just 16GB storage. Should have been 128GB atleast. How many apps can you download in 16GB. - Just 50 watts sound? - Just two years warranty? Why not four? because the processor slows down over time. 99k for just two years. - Just 3 GB RAM. Should have been 8GB atleast. Don't understand how well the TV will be able to process apps, resolution and sound with just 3GB RAM. It's performance is not that great. - Only 2 sub-woofer. Not even proper surround sound. All this for just 99K",Ask yourself....,B07W5QZQ45
"I bought oneplus TV from reliance digital. Delivery and installation was awesome from reliance digital. Its good tv and most of them are talking about positive things. Just want to share the bug which is there in TV software. 1. Restart issue - Restart option just shutdown the TV and it never switch on TV back. 2. youtube cast - youtube casting from mobile to TV does not work sometime. When you cast from mobile it just try to connect tv and it never cast. you have to restart TV to work. 3.Pinkish color effect there in some video in vivid picture option. workaround is to use standard mode. 4. Forward option does not work properly in default video player. Some time it hang and you have to go back to file browser and play again to work. It never remembers current video time, when you forward video in second time, it starts forward from where first forward was ended ( never starts froward from current video time) 5. Grains noise is coming when playing video in high volume and some of the video. Same video playing in other TV. 6. You will notice lag in prime videos when play initially ( Note: I have 150mbps internet speed). Immediately the TV try to play in high resolution and it get stuck. Oneplus TV need more software optimization and testing. If anyone is planning to buy, i suggest them to wait for sometime till they fix all software bugs.",Review after 2 weeks of usage.,B07W5QZQ45
"I got this in Rs.72499 + 5000 OFF at https://amzn.to/33y8C6E & extra warranty. Both PRO & basic OnePlus TVs features 4K QLED panel with a 95.7 percent screen-to-body ratio, however, only the Q1 Pro gets an integrated sliding soundbar. Lets see my quick review for this after 1 week of use. PROS: 1. It's Ok, OnePlus is Brand in the mobile segment but the TV segment is different. 2. 4k quality is good, One plus tv, the tv with oversaturated colors without “Netflix Certified.” 3. The colors don't look real and accurate on 1+plus TV, colors are highly saturated and there is a strong green and yellow tint in colors the white balance is also not accurate blues look sky-blue n sky blues looks teal greenish. 4. With a higher motion rate, you can fully enjoy fast GAMING performance. 5. The chargeable TV remote. 6. Dolby Vision 7. QLED panel will improve the viewing angle to 178 degrees. CONS: 1. It's overpriced. 2. Its motion rate, not refresh rate, its actual refresh rate is 200Hz 3. Oneplus misses the headphone jack. 4. Ports are really closer to each other... Sometimes we cannot connect two HDMI together at the same time. 5. They take 1 week for installation. 6. No Tabletop stand provided.",Got this in Rs.72499 + 5000 OFF at https://amzn.to/33y8C6E,B07W5QZQ45
This tv does not support Netflix despite you download Netflix app,Useless if you buy as expensive smart tv,B07W5QZQ45
"It is a very good TV, undoubtedly! It delivers awesome sound without even a bit of distortion. The picture quality is superb! For this rate, one can't expect anything more. Very good deal also. It has made other TV manufacturers to reduce prices so that they can survive. Expectations: 1.Netflix needs to be included. 2.Remote could have been designed still better, honestly. 3. Table stand should have been given by default. 4. Bit difficult to plug/insert cables once it's wall mounted. That irks. Changes can be considered in design in this regard in future. Overall, I am delighted after viewing its fabulous performance although I had my own doubts initially whether I had made a correct decision. Go and Grab the TV before stock gets over!",Superb 4K QLED TV by OnePlus,B07W5QZQ45

"Out of mind to keep sucha price. The ""quality comes at price"" but can't be difference of 3 times. Joke really !!",What a crazy price !!,B07W5QZQ45
"This is like iPhone nowadays.. too highly priced. You can buy a decent 55 4k TV at the price of 30k with 3 year warranty, where One plus TV with just 2 year warranty cost you 70k. If the seller itself giving us only 2 year warranty, when other brands like Mitashi & VU is giving 3 years, customers can just think the quality of TV is not great. Moral: craziness towards Style & brand name is lost Amazon, people are sensible enough to buy products matching value for money.",Too highly priced... not at all value for money!,B07W5QZQ45
It's been 10 days since I got the TV and still the installation has not happened. The brand is unable to provide a corner wall mount to the TV. And there is no alternative available.,Corner wall mount not available for the TV,B07W5QZQ45
"Viewing this TV for the past 15 days. Picture and sound quality is amazing. Demo from Amazon guy is poor. The person does not know or in a great hurry. Separately paying 3k for table top stand is not worth. If you touch TV it shakes, scarey. Suggest customers to go for Wall mounting. Remote built in battery is great, charging by guess. No indication. Big minus point. Overall it is a good purchase.","Great performance, value for money, Go for it",B07W5QZQ45

Stand - 3k extra. this is a disappointment. 70k tv does not even provide stand. but ok . stand is also ok ok not satisfactory as it wobbles whole tv when u plug in something to any ports. a star less for the stand. performance - u need to have speed above 20 mbps in order to play 4k content. conclusion - overall good enough. sad thing, installation - no facility provided from amazon or onelplus, had to get its arrangement on my own. 5 star for the product, but one star less for lack of installation facility, and a star less for the stand quality and sturdiness.",superb qled tv. buy this model don't go for pro model. 70k it's good enough. superb sound.,B07W5QZQ45

Well purchasing in amazon will be a bad idea coz you can see many complaints about the installation delay and everything.

I purchased Q1 pro there and their service is great. By the way,if you planning to buy this ,blindly go for it!",A BEAUTY INSIDE A BEAST,B07W5QZQ45
"Only after buying the Oneplus TV, I realised difference between QLED and LED. The picture looks far better than LED Tv. Please don’t compare price with LED TV. QLED is a different technology. The extra few thousands that you pay is for better quality picture and sound. Sound is great and clear. I found navigation to be ok, as to reach input option of TV I need to press button twice. An input key on remote would have been great to shuffle between cable and apps. That I would have appreciated installed Netflix, which is missing, but I resolved the problem with Amazon Firestick which was given to me free by TataSky. Oneplus says they are soon coming up with Netflix app in the TV. There is no Oneplus app for iphone, which again I was expecting from Oneplus. All in all, this television is value for money.",Oneplus QLED always better than LED,B07W5QZQ45

"Hardware : TV looks quite premium and sturdy with minimal bezels. Picture Quality : Both HDR non HDR contents looks great. XBOX 4K HDR games look amazing. Colors are punchy. Software : Needs lot of updates and bug fixes, youtube is stuttering continuously, bluetooth audio has static noise and audio delay. Most of the streaming apps stutter while playing 4K HDR content. Hope all the bugs are fixed soon via software updates. Alexa integration and commands works great. Remote Control: I did not like the stock aluminum remote, looks great but not very practical. Most used buttons are missing ""Inputs, Mute, Picture Mode, Power off"" (Long press 1+ button is slow) rather use Alexa to turn off. I did get free updates remote from oneplus with website, Its far better than the original remote. Comes with Netflix, Youtube, Input buttons) Hope oneplus ships this with new orders. I am very happy with my purchase, just hoping for bug fixes.","Great hardware, far from perfect software.",B07W5QZQ45

70000 for Chinese brand seems like a wastage of money. Over saturated pictures is the worst thing about this TV. Secondly android operating system is inferior compared to LG's Webos. If you want to spend 70000 choose wisely. Go for LG television they're way ahead of all the peers. One will buy this TV who's happy to waste hard earn money on this cheap product.,Waste of money one plus brand.,B07W5QZQ45
I was quite impressed with the TV in terms of Quality . It is well built and looks smart. SD content don't look nice however the TV does justice to HD contents. 4K comes our beautifully. The colors at times do feel over saturated specially the Red. Very poor Installation service. I was delivered the TV in Oct and no one turned up to Install the same. I finally ended up doing it myself. I hope the response is not the same in case of any defects which only time will tell.,Poor post delivery istallation service,B07W5QZQ45

"The picture quality was average and now there is a big black vertical bar coming on the TV. We have already complained to them and so far we are only following with them to make a visit and replace this faulty tv which is 2 month’s old. The SAGA continues, We called the warranty claim service , no one came physically despite the assigned date and time. One person calls and says it will take 35 K to repair it without even seeing it. When we informed that TV is only 2 months old , the person said the Amazon guaranty is only for 10 days and it is over, One plus will not entertain these complaints. WHAAAT ??? Is it a fraud or what..","Sub standard product,TV stopped working after 2 months. Running from pillar to post for replacement",B07W5QZQ45

"It's been about a month of daily usage and the only thing that disappointed me was the sound. Though it is a 50W speaker, the sounds come out feeling a little muffled. Though point has to be noted that it could also be because of the way our living room is shaped, so results may vary. Picture quality is really good for the price but yes, the HDR is not as good as in OLEDs, so if you can afford it, you should go for an OLED TV. 4k content on it looks pretty good, but while playing 1080p content, you can see that the upscaling is not particularly great. The UI is pretty smooth and clean, both while using the remote or the android app. The TV looks at home in the most beautiful at decors and just seems like a good purchase as far as I feel.",Good enough at the price.,B07W5QZQ45

"This TV IS A QLED AND NOT AN OLED. The MAIN DIFFERENCE between a QLED and OLED is that QLED is a LCD panel who backlight is lit by HUGE LEDs. OLED display is have their own millions LEDs to emit light in the display. Hence, The picture quality of OLED is very much better than QLED. QLED TVs are thicker than OLEDs. I'm NOT saying that QLEDs are bad, I'm just trying to explain the technology difference. If you need the TV for purely entertainment purpose, I suggest you to buy a Samsung AMOLED or LG OLED TV. But also remember the price of OLED TV is double the price of QLED TV. Please hit the like if you found this review helpful. Thanks.",DON'T BUY WITHOUT READING THIS!!!!!!!! QLED VS OLED,B07W5QZQ45

"Used this TV just for one month and i see a grey bar at the center of the screen which is very annoying . Despite raising the ticket with one plus and sending them all the proofs there has not been much progress . Just FYI , i am writing this review after waiting for 12 days to hear from One Plus . Worst part is that One Plus doesn't even get back to me unless i call up the Customer Care every 2 days . Though it has a warranty and the TV picture quality is good I would advice people to wait for 2 to 3 versions until the TV issues get stabilized or go for a different brand .",Grey Bar at the Center of the screen after one month of Usage,B07W5QZQ45
