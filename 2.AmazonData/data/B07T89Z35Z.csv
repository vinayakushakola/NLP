Poor quality item. please improve it ....... Mi LED TV 4A PRO 108 cm (43) Full HD Android TV (Black),Poor quality item. please improve it,B07T89Z35Z
"On papers the product looks good. However, when you start using it, issues will crop up in series. I am regretting buying this tv as it cannot be called a smart TV. They claim many things, but not everything work as expected. 1) Cannot connect it to wifi- WiFi connection keeps on dropping every minute. You can't use this tv as SMART TV. I raised a repair after struggling many days thinking that my internet connection is not strong. It took 6 days for them to come and check after I raised the request. The engineer said the problem is with my wifi router as TV is not compatible with TP Link router (which is absurd, why would you sell a tv which is not compatible with most used router brand) even though my other devices are working perfectly fine on the network. To that argument, i tried connecting TV to my phone hotspot. Connecting doesn't work in this case also. When i informed the engineer about this, he suggested me to connect tv to ethernet cable to use SMART features (in this case I cannot cast from any other device). The other issue is they are not trying to resolve the issue. 2) They claim it has Google play store. Honestly, it is useless. There are very few app which are usable. Even Netflix is not available. 3) You can't chrome cast all the apps. It support only limited set of apps. Cannot cast Netflix. 4) Patchwall which they advertise as its USP is actually useless. I never used it and i don't think anybody is using it to watch anything. 5) Very slow in opening apps and booting up. Not recommended if are looking for a smart TV. Can work if you only want to watch cable TV. In that case you much cheaper option available.","Bad product, no service support. Don't buy.",B07T89Z35Z
"I got it (43"") in 20k during sale. Worth every penny. Only downside is that it doesn't have IPS panel even through its a full hd tv which doesn't make sense, I am not gamer but gamers deserve IPS panel when they are buying a full hd tv so 1 star less only because it doesn't have IPS panel because this same model has IPS panel shown Tech Singh on his YouTube but end users are not getting the same. Amazon prime and Netflix is supported and will be automatically added when you update to the android version 9 which is available, go to settings and check for updates. Those who need subtitles for watching movies should know that the default video player doesn't support subtitles so if you want to watch videos with subtitles you should install vlc player, just make sure that the video file and subtitle file has the same name, just open the vlc player and give permission to storage and all your video files will be showing in vlc app, just click on the video u wamt to watch and subtitle will automatically work. Next day delivery by Amazon even during big sale and same day installation by Xiaomi on delivery date. Kudos to both for this. Remember, keep ₹500 ready if you want wall mount during installation. That is the price for wall mount only, if you don't take wall mount then you don't have to pay anything and get the installation done as table top. This is initial review just wanted help to those who think that this tv doesn't have amazon prime and Netflix or that it doesn't support subtitles. More review will follow in due course.",Value for money!,B07T89Z35Z
"I'm so disappointed with this product and Amazon service both. Firstly the product description never mentioned that you need to have a WiFi router just near the TV for it to work. This TV doesn't work even if the router is Jus 5 ft away. And Amazon - I tried explaining this to Amazon customer care so many times, but the answer I got was - Amazon doesn't take any return in electronics, it can only fix only if there's is a techinical issue. Not directly, but they asked me to change the layout of my house & rebuild it to suit the TV. I'm done shopping with amazon!!",DO NOT BUY THIS. NOT FROM AMAZON ATLEAST.,B07T89Z35Z
"This is quick review after installation for those who are about to buy, will repost if there are other observations. To the point feedback: Dont think further go for it! Pros: TV supports netflix and prime video after update, side loading not required (check screen images ) YouTube after update works flawlessly Screen mirroring as expected (minor lag as with all screen mirror apps ) HD videos works excellent. 4k videos are a treat to eyes. Side loading of apps easy peasy task. Low power consumption 4star rated tv. Amazon service excellent (delivery & installation) installation team called 4 times to confirm after installation. Cons: Dedicated mute button missing (can use google assistant to mute by giving voice command). Restarts couple of time if software is not updated,wich means without internet it might give some trouble for basic users. Sound quality can go better with this type of tv. Google assistant can go a bit better as at times mic doesn't recognise the command. Some sideloaded apps not work as expected. Could have provided extra memory as its a smart tv and buyer would like to load many apps wich requires extra space. NOTE: Above is day 1 experience, will share more after some days or if there is anything which requires attention.",Go for it! Value for Money.,B07T89Z35Z
"I bought it in the name of smart tv and cheap price. I'm disappointed with majorly two points: 1. Poor picture quality. I had Full HD connection. And, the quality is superb on my another TV (Samsung smart tv). But, the quality is so bad that I confirmed from my provider whether the connection is running on HD! 2. There is no Amazon Prime, Netflix App support in app. And, they are promoting their shitty patchwall app. This TV is good for people experiencing their first smart tv and that too in tight budget. Else, dont go for this TV. Samsung is best in this business.",Looks like Windows XP in the era of Windows 10,B07T89Z35Z
"Superb smart android TV in such a excellent price, it's really value for money . Super picture and sound quality. Good smart features. Smoth connectivity and screen cast is also good through crime cast features",Superb android TV in such a excellent price,B07T89Z35Z
TV stopped working after 6 th day of installation. Purchase date 5 Oct 19 Installation date 10 Oct 19 Return/ Replace window closed on 16 Oct 19 Replacement facilitie of 10 day is after installation. Here in my case return/replace window closed after 6 th day of installation. This is wrong. Very poor service from Amazon and MI TV -Atul Jadhav. Nashik 9860595996,TV stopped working after 6 day. Can't be replaced.,B07T89Z35Z
"This is extremely pathetic led and in fact a fraud. This MI Led is of extremely low quality and my new TV images are blurred with no sharpness. I have been following up with Amazon to get the issue resolved but they are simply not taking any interest. It would have been better if we buy such items from shops. Also the servicing company has scheduled 5 visits but never came even once. This is totally crap. Post buying , neither Amazon nor MI nor servicing company will take interest in ur woes.",Horrible LED. So not fall for trap. Very bad service from Amazon.,B07T89Z35Z
"-Ordered on Sunday, -Received on Monday. -got a call from the installation agent exactly at the time on product delivery. -30 min from then the agent came home and installed the TV 43"" with a new wall mount(charges 500rs). -checked all the features and they all work perfect -casting is just one click away. cant have Amazon prime :( got to figure out a work around can download some apps (like VLC, etc) through play store Overall good TV.","Happy, Satisfied, I Recommend this product",B07T89Z35Z
Hi guys I have purchased MI TV in the month of July it's been 4 months now for the first time now we got crash error ...posted crash pictures ... requesting MI team to check and improve Thier product service ...now there is no chance even to return ..so PPL check and buy ..just don't see cost reduction ...also see reviews peropely and go for it ...o would not recommend ...buried for 22k and now we have issue...BiG no to this MiTv,MI TV crashes after 4months usage ..BIG NO TO MI....WASTE OF MONEY,B07T89Z35Z
"Here is my first week experience! Got the tv on Thursday and the Amazon installation was scheduled for Saturday. The installation happened as scheduled. On the tv, oh it takes ages to load. Mine took 1hr to load only then i realised i had to turn on the power switch. The screen yeah, when i push it... it goes beyond gilgit baltistan and towards Karachi. And then i decided not to push so far. Regarding free content i decided to contact Sundar Pichai to see if MI tv purchasers can be given free access to everything premium. Still waiting for confirmation from him. And besides all the above my MI Android tv works just fine. A brilliant tv for 22k that i paid. Can connect my laptop and mobile device to it. Loading time was not even a minute. Just set it up with your Google account and then navigation is a breeze. This is my bedroom tv and absolutely good looking. Go for it and don't believe the many low ratings as rightly pointed out by one reviewer... they expect 100k performance from a 30k tv.",Works just fine!,B07T89Z35Z
TV is not working even is not restarting. It's being less than 18 hours I have been using it. And have major problem with WiFi it's not reconnecting if once lost connection. Please check the video.,Worst device to purchase .. not working,B07T89Z35Z
"Just unpacked and installed, however much to my dismay brand new remote isn't working! Have raised complaint but no concrete response even after a few days. Quality control looks like suspect as MI scales the Indian markets. Am not sure how durable this one is going to be. 29.10.19 After raising complaint the service partner landed up 5 hours late that too after bailing one day due to weather. Remote was not working and now Amazon has washed it's hand off asking to contact MI directly. Unless you are an extremely lucky person please don't buy this product on amazob",Remote not working and horribly amazing Amazon experience,B07T89Z35Z
"Value for money. Doesn't support Netflix so, you will need a firestick or you can use the built-in Chromecast. The TV ends up freezing at times when connected to Amazon firestick and we have had trouble with the TV not recognising the firestick device. We did the good old restart and it worked. I am sure there are better TVs out there but they are also more expensive so, it is up to you. Voice recognition is decent since it's android based.",Value for money,B07T89Z35Z
"Bought the MiTV 4A PRO 43"" during dussehra sale. I own a Micromax FHD LED tv (not smart TV) & an LG UHD tv. Here is what i felt after using the Mi TV 1. For the discounted price, it's worth the buy! 2. This tv doesn't come close to the LG one. LG costs higher. Both picture & sound quality is much better than MiTV. WebOS, even though has lesser apps than android, is much better designed & responsive than MiTV's OS 3. Patchwall OS that comes with the MiTV is waste. So is the remote, when comparing to LG's magic remote. So far, you might think this is a biased review. When compared to Micromax. 1. The FHD tag on Micromax is a sham. Even my phone screen looks better. MiTv has much superior video & audio than Micromax. 2. Had seen some users reporting about os complaints with the MiTV. I faced no such issue. Os lags alot, snail pace to boot up & update, but never unresponsive. I use only apps that i need, no junk apps are allowed to run. 3. Got the update to Android 9.0, along with Netflix & prime apps. Really worth the update. 4. Patchwall is a sham. Content is waste, not free also. Final verdict: If you are in a budget range, know how to use a smart tv, go ahead. Compared to my Micromax FHD tv, the picture is really superb. Micromax can't even get close to this quality. Compared to my LG, both are inferior in terms of quality, features & performance",A Smart tv worth considering,B07T89Z35Z
"It is very surprising that neither the Warranty card nor the User's manual was found in the box. The delivery boy told that this would be taken care of by Installation person as he had opened the sealed box in my presence. The installation person told that whatever is there in the box are the standard items supplied by the company. I would however like to say that whatever be the cause, I want the User's Manual as well as Warranty Card, which may be got sent to me at the earliest.",Missing User's manual and Warranty Card,B07T89Z35Z
Promptly delivered by amazon. Installation delayed and rescheduled. Awesome picture Quality. Sound very clear. Needs improvement Amazon Prime and Netflix not preloaded. Bluetooth is not capable of connecting beyond 6ft. 4k videos do not play Internet connection should be stronger than 20mbps for a streaming videos.. Overall good set with reasonable price.,Smart tv loaded with good features,B07T89Z35Z
"The TV is good and it has all the features that are needed in a smart tv. But the amazon service is the worst service. The installation services are not at all good. The agents will make up some stories for you to avoid the service. And these amazon people are so much supportive to them. I’ve bought this tv and the installations services are scheduled two days after the purchase. Nobody shown up. It’s better if you order it from flipkart. Amazon is not so trustworthy for large appliances, products are ok. But services are the worst.",Worst service,B07T89Z35Z
The tv is good and you will love it if its your 1st smart tv. But if you have already used some other high brand smart tv then u will find it just an ok type. The picture quality is good and is the only best feature of this tv. The panel looks very mediocre. The processing is slow. Takes longer time to start. Sound quality is good but it could have been better. I won't say its a bad product but at the same time its not that much good either. The price of the product justifies its quality but if can afford a higher priced tv then go for some other higher brand tv.,Price justified TV,B07T89Z35Z
"Some people says installation process is too late but at my time led tv. Is not coming to home, installation person coming at the same day 1hour before the delivery of the led. I am suprising.. 😂😂 This is a awesome product. Picture quality is too good . At this price this product is awesome.",This product is a 7star 🌟,B07T89Z35Z
"My TV arrived 2 weeks back. My installment appointments have been postponed by installer four times. They just give a lame excuse of not finding address, when hundreds of Amazon delivery agents could reach my house with out any problem. No one bothered to even inform me that they are not coming. Their appointments are meaningless. Everytime when I contacted Amazon service centre, they only promptly rescheduled the appointment. When I called them last time, I was told that it is MI TV's responsibility and not Amazon's concern. Further I was told that Amazon neither cares whatever review I submit nor if I stop buying anything from Amazon. Now if I get it installed from a outside technician, the warranty will be worthless.",Installation problems,B07T89Z35Z
"Good TV and I am happy with it. Picture quality is good, sound quality is resonable. Packing and delivry by amazon were as usual good. Voice recognition could have been a bit better but that would be nit picking. For those who have issues with Prime Video and Netflix not being included in the boquet, believe me, casting from the mobile apps for both of them works like a charm, tried it out myself. And for those who feel that casting is not an option, buy an amazon fire stick and you would still be better off from the ""overall dent in the wallet"" standpoit. Update - Nov 3, 2019 - In order to make things complete, Xiaomi has done an Over The Air update of the software which has brought both Netflix and Prime Video as part of the pre-installed apps. The software has also been upgraded to the next version of Android. As such, at this price, this is a steal !!!",You don't need to rob a bank for being smart...,B07T89Z35Z
"I am writing the review after one month. First of all, thanks to Amazon for a early delivery. Delivered on the next day. Both picture and sound quality of the TV are awesome. We can also adjust both sound & display settings manually. Inbuilt chromecast is a bonus. Loved it. Patchwall and voice recognition works fine. Overall a must buy TV in this price range. Highly recommended.",BEST SMART ANDROID TV IN THIS PRICE RANGE,B07T89Z35Z
"Pros: TV video quality is good. Casting worked very good. Cons: Streaming using android apps is not so good as it gets struck at times, but while casting using same apps everything works just perfect. Audio quality does get poor at times when connected to wifi & buletooth speaker at the same time. Overall as tv its good(4.5 out of 5), but as a smart tv it's okay(3 out of 5)",Good TV but need improvement in smart features,B07T89Z35Z
Good android tv in this price but remote is not working properly Amazon service good bcz only remote damage so he said refund amount but after resolve issue so I do cancel my refund status bcz i want smart TV but I suggested don't buy u should go only 4k bcZ only 5000 paid extra but u provide high pixel quality,Average,B07T89Z35Z
"Got a steal deal during offer period, after sbi card discount I got this led in around 18 K. Picture quality is perfect Inbuilt apps are performing absolutely fine Sound output is good. Service & installation :- One of the Most important topic for this TV. I have seen many people are complaining about the installation but trust me the installation team is very professional. They have given proper demo and clearly detailed about merits and demerits of this product. Now the performance, till now it seems like a great device. 4 star out of 5",Nice TV with good installation and demo.,B07T89Z35Z
Picture quality is very good. Audio quality is good. Size is perfect for all occasions. But only drawback is it doesn't support Netflix. Both Netflix and Amazon Prime apps not available to down from App store. So can't say it's a real android tv,Not so smart,B07T89Z35Z
"Very nice experience...we were not sure to buy MI tv but it turned out really good...smart Android TV... You can install apps like zee5, aaj Tak, humgamaplay, YouTube, etc..and enjoy watching movies...also connect amazon fire TV stick and watch prime videos... No need to connect for TV cable or any DTH set top box if you don't watch TV for serials",Very nice,B07T89Z35Z
"Very difficult to connect through Google Cast, Mobile screen cast hangs after every 15 mins. Takes lot of time to load. I was using LCD TV with Firestick and it was working perfectly fine. Whereas at the same location, this TV is not able to load because of Internet connection issue",Not as expected. Wrong chocie !,B07T89Z35Z
I have returned this product within 10 days. I observed black marks on the screen. We must understand that Quality is cost..! You can't get the quality product at this price tag. Now I m using Samsung smart TV and its far better than MI. Thought I paid some extra to get this quality. If you are only focusing on cheap TV then go for it. Or else go for some branded names like LG Samsung Sony etc.,Good at price but poor in quality.,B07T89Z35Z
"Using since 1-2 months. Satisfied with the physical TV, interface, picture quality etc. However be aware of its serious compatibility issues. In short - apps aligned to MI/Android such as Hotstar, ZEE5 etc. work well. Apps not aligned to it such as Netflix, Prime Video, Airtel TV are a struggle: 1. These apps are not pre-installed which is not an issue, but they are also not available on the TV's Google Play Store 2. You therefore have to install them through a process involving a USB stick which again is something I can easily live with - but then they do not function properly. Netflix works but the navigation is slightly sub-par. Prime Video worked for a few weeks now it just hangs, have reinstalled and tried every other fix but it does not work on my TV anymore. Airtel TV is displayed inverted on my TV, not been to fix it no matter what 3. I also feel seriously cheated by the in-built chromecast. In my previous home I used to have an external chromecast device to which I was able to cast Netflix, Prime Video and othe apps from my Apple devices without any hitch whatsoever. You cant do that with MI TV's in-built chromecast - for many apps the cast does not connect at all, for others it casts with a poor picture quality. This has been confirmed to me as normal by MI TV's customer care Overall if you are looking to use the TV for apps such as Netflix, Prime Video, Airtel TV (and maybe more) I do not think this is the right TV - you will have interface, connectivity and compatibility issues. I feel cheated because I bought this TV among others in this budget for its in-built chromecast and similar features. MI TV now tells me that since these are compatibility issues and not defects I just have to live with them :(",Serious Compatibility Issues,B07T89Z35Z
"After installation came to know that Netflix and amazon prime cannot be installed in it. Picture quality is good when compared to prices . Disappointed that Netflix and prime video not working . Amazon should have mentioned in features that Netflix and amazon prime will not work ,",Donot buy if you are using Netflix and amazon prime,B07T89Z35Z
"Pros: It was a good experience to shop with Amazon. As usual, Amazon was very prompt in its delivery service ( Though the delivery date made me wait for long). Thank you Amazon for an extremely lovable deal. Wish to shop with you with such more deals. Tons of thanks!! About TV: After two days of usage, I'm happy with performance of the TV. The picture and sound quality is certainly upto the mark. After few months, I would certainly review the TV once again. The smart features are quite good. So is the case with the voice recognition facility. It's my first android TV and I'm satisfied with its performance. Cons: The demo service was not upto the mark. The technician was considerably negligent about the various features of the TV. I requested for the knowledgeable technician to visit but a teenager looking person was sent. I'd have been happy to know about the features for the expert.",Thank you Amazon and MI! For the happiness in this festive season!!,B07T89Z35Z

"2 weeks after we bought it, we got TV remote connectivity issue. Sometimes remote worked sometimes it didn't. Later now , even sound is not coming from the TV. Amazon people washed their hands off the issue. I am calling Mi TV web service multiple times, their ticketing system is pathetic : we have repeat all the details on spite of previous tickets. Still, they sometimes disconnect the call inbetween It's not enough if a product is good, it must good backup service too.

Tv is good in terms of smart features and picture quality. 2 problems I faced: 1. Wifi connection is not stable. The speed also varies. 2. No direct installation for prime video and Netflix I wish the remote could have more direct buttons for certain applications and other features since there is a lot of empty space on the remote.,Good,B07T89Z35Z
"Was not very happy with the unit that was sent to me, it was a Made in China unit and I thought MI although Chinese makes their India specific items in India.

"I purchased the TV in Oct 2019. I had a Vu 43' TV earlier, and use a Sony Hometheatre for better sound.

"I didn't buy it from Amazon. Was an offline purchase. The build quality is good and the display is very good. It supports full HD resolution. You can find the technical details anywhere on the net. The TV has 3 USB and 1 HDMI port. Works great to connect with laptops. It has Bluetooth so Bluetooth earphones and mouse , external speakers can be connected easily. Supports Amazon prime through third party apps. It's remote is uniquely designed to have only essential buttons as you mostly have a different remote for set top boxes. Using it since last 7 months and I have no complains. I usually use YouTube and Hotstar apps to view contents and it works perfectly. Only drawback I think is that there is no web browser inbuilt or in app store. One will not be able to browse web in this product. I have a old Samsung smart TV and it does have web browsing. Other than that I have nothing to complain.",Value for money. Great display and Chromecast supported.,B07T89Z35Z
"6 days after i purchased this 43in pro tv, beautiful vertical line is seeing on the screen. The os is too slow. Compared to the price, this can be adjustable. Always opt for extension warranty coz you badly need this. Edited later: After I contacted and filed A complaint in mi , they sent two people to check whether complaint was genuine or not and later they replaced tv and said i registered the problem within 7 days after installation so i got this replacement else they only correct the pblm of the old one. Btw i felt happy at last.",My first tv got damaged later they replaced. price is the only benefit,B07T89Z35Z
"Xiaomi’s products have taken the Indian market by storm. When it comes to smartphones, there is no other company which comes close to what Xiaomi offers in terms of affordability. The Xiaomi Mi LED TV 4A Pro is a good buy for someone looking to buy a budget TV in the Rs 20,000 price range. I am really happy for purchasing it got it installed in two days only. Great Smart features and picture quality of it impressed me totally, Voice recognition is also top notch! Thanks Amazon for this amazing product.

I Contemplated buying one of those cheap Chinese brand first but I had heard so many horror stories from friends about the poor quality and limited service availability that I eventually went for a premium product. I have a lot of product from Samsung at home and I am very happy with them so I went for Samsung. Sharing my observations from using it for a few days: The TV was delivered and installed on time without any follow ups. It is a top notch premium looking UHD TV with sharp picture quality Cannot be replaced by Chinese TVs. The sound is loud for enough for my room size and vocal clarity is awesome it has Dolby digital . I used the tune station app once- it allows me to play music While the TV screen is off. I some times pair my phone with Tv. Screen Mirroring work without any lag .,Samsung is best tv in regional prices.,B07T89Z35Z

Best Android TV u can get in this price range.. first of all there is no such brightness issue as reported by other users reviewing after 3 days of extensive usage. Cons- 1- for 1 instance i feeled some lag in switching from android tv to patchwall 2- u need to be careful with remote just 1 miss hit button can exit Ur movie or even power it down..( we r used to infrared) 3-port should be in side not at the back because once u wall mount. it become very difficult to access if u dont have enough space in right side of the tv. Pros - 1- viewing angle angles are really great. 2- i think pathwall is bettr then ANDROID tv if services of android is used together with patchwall 3- picture clarity is tooo good. 4-value for money product 5- installation technision is just too good and friendly even its his off on 26 jan he came and installed the tv nd gave proper demo.. Just go for it ..it is the best available product that u can get in this range ANd dont forget to buy extemded warranty along with it .it will become very handy during any mishap with the tv.,Brilliant,B07T89Z35Z
One of the best tv I used before the picture quality and the sound quality is soo good this tv give us great experience and this is a smart tv so you can watch any thing you want as mi is a great brand that you can trust but the one problem is that this tv is not ultra HD and Netflix and Amazon prime doesn't work in this without fire stick other wise this is perfect tv,Delightful,B07T89Z35Z
The tv is good and you will love it if its your 1st smart tv. But if you have already used some other high brand smart tv then u will find it just an ok type. The picture quality is good and is the only best feature of this tv. The panel looks very mediocre. The processing is slow. Takes longer time to start. Sound quality is good but it could have been better. I won't say its a bad product but at the same time its not that much good either. The price of the product justifies its quality but if can afford a higher priced tv then go for some other higher brand tv.,Price justified TV,B07T89Z35Z
"I have taken this 43 inch smart TV from Mi. Even before that I have another TV of 55 inch which I took from Amazon itself.I had taken that 55 inch TV around 50 thousand but I have taken this 43 inch TV in 23000, I am very happy that I got a very good product at very low prices.If you talk about picture quality or sound effects, all of them are working perfectly and have been a very good experience since I started watching it.",Really Smart Tv by Mi,B07T89Z35Z
