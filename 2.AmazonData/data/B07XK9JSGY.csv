"Though it is android TV comes with pre-installed PRIME VIDEO and other Video apps, Prime video and other apps are getting crashed. i have raised complaint to Amazon to troubleshoot the issue and their technician has reported that TV has issues without showing-up to my house . i've also contacted VU customer service, they said this model has issue. i really had bad experience with amazon service. the lesson i learnt is buy it from your local shops around you, instead of going through this hardship. Zero Star for their valuable service. i don't thing Amazon will post my review.",Beware of VU Ultra Android TV,B07XK9JSGY
"So, bought this TV during the recent Great Indian sale. 1) This TV is apt for viewing distance of 10-15 feet - Comes with the wall mount. 2) The picture quality and sound is actually good - Not attaching images as I am not good with photography. 3) Pre-installed apps are working fine (Netflix/Zee5/Hotstar/the usual runners). 4) Play store provides ample other options. What's not working: 1) So, this probably is a Amazon Prime issue. I am not sure (need to call Amazon) but my Prime is not working. Like the device is registering to my account however when I try to play the video - I get a msg to go to amazon.com/videohelp. Which really is not helping. I can cast via my phone though so I guess, it's not a complete dead end. 2) Phone mirroring works however lags by a few seconds. Overall, a must buy at the discounted price that I bought it - INR 18k. Final word, a big thank you to the installation team. Missed the first schedule (understandable during sale season) however, second run wasn't a Miss and the guy was good. No hassle and polite.",When a woman reviews,B07XK9JSGY
Nice as under 12k. Will update review and share once use for six months .as I seen it's required proper 4g speed which not available in india at all locations even in metro.,Nice as per price,B07XK9JSGY
TV installation completed after 12 days... It's disappointed us as the service is poor... But the quality of the TV is very good... Smart TV functionally I didn't check. I will update after using some months. Blindly go for this brand if you need a better one with in your budget price. This is my third VU TV purchase for my family members.,Very good TV brand with a average service...,B07XK9JSGY
"Amazon gave false commitment stating Amazon prime will work while buying tv, but now customer support team said prime video won't support in the tv",Amazon prime not supported in this TV,B07XK9JSGY
Good but Amazon prime doesn't work with the inbuilt app. Also some inbuilt app force close themselves. Buggy software. Update: There was an update to the software. Amazon prime is working now. Good quality TV with super clarity and colour reproduction.,Good,B07XK9JSGY
The delivery was on time ...but NO one came for installation ... No one called ... Coming to voice - its low ... Amazon prime video - if you are a paid member - still doesn't work ... Called amazon - according to them we need to wait for the update only then it will work - and they dont know when the update will be released... Pretty unhappy with this buy ...,Unhappy,B07XK9JSGY
This tv is good sale if you get during great indian sale with exchange...bank discount ...with Amazon pay balance 1000 cashback.... Everything is good ...only one thing missing is voice search.... I have installed android remote control and connect with Bluetooth option..Google voice search works fine....,Nice tv with latest.,B07XK9JSGY
"Tv is with me, no installation from past 2 days. No proper timeline and response also. Now installation done. But coming to tv look and working, it’s simply awesome. Prime also working after reset/update tv os. Cool tv and best budget in this price. Voice option remote could be better.",Too much delay in installation,B07XK9JSGY
"The company is duping customers.. pls never buy VU TV..plus never buy white goods from Amazon during festive sale..their installation team will ruin your zeal by keeping installation pending for one month and then making item non returnable. PL use only brand arranged installation and not Amazon home services one. Actually, without Google voice assistant feature on its remote, it is not fully Android smart TV.. we have to struggle a lot for search icon.",Poor quality by VU TV,B07XK9JSGY
"True Android TV running smoothly on Android 9.0. Pros - Total value for money, way ahead of Mi Tv or any other low budget buy in this price range Android 9.0 and all featured apps working like a charm Decent looks and premium remote Cons- Sound quality, picture clarity is slightly under par when compared to LGs, Sony, and Samsungs but hey you are paying way less for it. **Prime Videos were not working initially but after an OS update and restart, it is working seamlessly.",Amazon Prime now working !!,B07XK9JSGY
"Picture quality and sound quality is very good in this price range. Apps are working fine. Build and look is classy. Another master piece from VU brand. This is value for money deal as other brands smart tv are overpriced in this category. I bought this in sale so received good discount. This is my second review for TV. After my first review, VU customer care proactively contacted me and did the installation on committed date. So no problem with VU. Excellent service. I will add more detailed review after using TV for 2 months. But Amazon and VECare need to improve their service and professionalism.",Amazing Smart TV from VU brand,B07XK9JSGY
"Sound and pocture is very awesome. All apps is working fine like..youtube , netflex,primevedio. Even we can install external apps via Downloading apk in google crome. If anyone want to buy it go for it.",Very Nice TV,B07XK9JSGY
"Thanks to the recent update, amazon prime app is working fine now, satisfied with the product.",No prime video support,B07XK9JSGY
Amazon prime video works after factory reset and setting it up once again. The update resolves the issue of prime not working. All other features are superb. Picture quality is one of the best. Sound is superb,Amazon prime works after update,B07XK9JSGY
"Honest Review. *Price- I got this with exchange and card discounts at 12k.. Without exchange u can het this around 17k. *Display - I am a marvel fan, i like to watch super heroes movies and this TV is a treat. Good clarity, color reproduction. No complaints from my end on this.. Yes i have observed that when we see from side closely we see little negative images maybe because of big screen to believe me this won't be a problem as i never had.. We see movies from from not from completely edge side of tv right.. *Sound - Sound is decent don't expect to work like soundbar.. I had LG tv earlier and comparing that with this sound is 40% better louder and clear.. But if u wish to have home theatre experience get home theater.. *Processor- To be honest i dont have any technical info on this but yes i download 1080p HD BluRay Movies in HEVC (Highly compress) format. My LG TV never read this format but this TV play smoothly without any glitches.. I have also downloaded MX player (as this is android tv). *Casting- Yes this is where i removed one star.. Casting need Internet connection unlike other Mi smart tv which works directly without Internet. Was very difficult for me to cast mobile to TV, at the end i used my mobile hot-spot to do so. This can be resolved with firestick (i had this earliesr to make my normal LG TV smart) or any other smart casting device which normally cost 1k. If anyone knows how to cast offline in this TV pls let me know. *Connectivity - No problem here.. It has Bluetooth, wifi, 3.5 jack, HDMI Arc.... Refer my screenshot.. Conclusion : With this said i am happy with my android TV.. I get real Theater experience with big screen watching HD movies.. You would get many reviews here but believe me there is nothing in this TV which may make u regret buying it..",Budget Android TV,B07XK9JSGY
"Plain cheating by Vu - this TV does not support Prime Video and Netflix, although the apps come pre-loaded and the remote comes with dedicated buttons. Secondly, it's got an extremely slow processor. Even YouTube takes a lot of time to load. Lastly, it was a nightmare to return this TV. I must have spent several hours over one week with Amazon customer care, to finally get the return approved. Both Prime Video Customer Care as well as the Vu company's technicians told me that this TV wouldn't run Prime Video and Netflix. It's shocking that Vu is so blatantly misleading their online customers; equally shocking is the fact that Amazon is also not doing anything about it.",Avoid! Don't get carried away by the ad,B07XK9JSGY
"Be careful where you Buy it from, I purchased from cloudtail ltd And the follow up for installation was never ending. However when Vu got involved the matter was resolved very quickly. The product is good and user friendly takes 2 seconds to start up and change between apps but otherwise a lovely product.",Great value,B07XK9JSGY
Got a new update and now TV is good But with all the apps the free space is less,Value for money,B07XK9JSGY
"Extremely happy with the customer first approach taken by VU. Received a call from Prashanth (VU) and all the queries/issues were addressed. Besides, the performance of the TV is as per the expectation. The Amazon Prime Video issue is also fixed now.",Good Product,B07XK9JSGY
Nice TV. Value for money.,Go for it,B07XK9JSGY
"Well for starters the complete playstore is not available. I could not even find Google Chrome but yes the picture quality is excellent and the sound too has become quite good since my first Vu TV. Overall a very good buy. So what exactly did I do for it to work. Firstly stop all updates. Not even system update cause the screen just stays put and nothing gets installed. Next step was to start installing desirable apps & to me the first I needed was a file explorer & a browser I found in playstore by searching just those words. Once that was done I did a system update. Now I can run any App bit Prime Video. When I try to log in it says can't login register on Prime ideo/MyTV. When I give the hashkey provided it says registration successful but on seeing devices registered this TV won't be found. So basically a dead end. Casting is slow but you need to only cast prime video else everything else can be side loaded. That is search for the app on your phone and install it via USB using file explorer. Yes Thope TV, Oreo TV, Typhoon TV, etc will work seamlessly. So basically it is not so simple but once you do everything falls in place. Would I recommend it? Damn well I will for at this price you get an excellent screen, sound again is very good & almost any Android App can be installed. No not Jio TV. I can see only half the screen! Update... Well when folks from VuTv called for feedback I did tell them about the Amazon Prime issue. The caller noted it down and sent me a PDF file containing the solution. It was upgrading OS to a Sep release & doing a reset. Now I had installed Apps & was wary of doing a reset. Now they called again to check if I had done the update or needed help. I said I hadn't done but they said everything would be fine. So I did a reset and was able to login to Amazon Prime & it worked. Also the sluggishness of casting got solved. So I am upgrading the rating to 5 stars from 4...",Thumbs up!! Upgrading to 5 stats,B07XK9JSGY
"Purchased less than a week. Prime video is not working. I buy this from Amazon as a prime member yet prime video doesn't work. I need this to be fixed. Have registered a complaint today. Netflix, Hotstar works well.",Amazon Prime does not work,B07XK9JSGY
"Amazing Build Quality ,picture and sound and software is a little bit messy at first because Amazon Prime will not work ,so what i did was contacted VU Technical Support and they have released an update of 852 mb.Now you should install that update and once again check Amazon Prime,if the problem persists you should factory reset your smart TV.This will automatically updates the old version to new version and Amazon prime will work Flawlessly. Google chromecast works fine nothing to worry about.casted a Amazon prime video (when inbuilt app was not working ) for about 3 hours without issue Need to check Netflix and Kodi and keep you posted.",Amazon Prime will work with an Update,B07XK9JSGY
"1) Color and brightness, overall display is very good 2) Wifi connectivity is excellent 3) If you want to enable 1080p display, you need to turn on both ""Game Mode & PC Mode"" in advanced video option. 4) Sound quality is very good when you turn on ""DTS-StudioSound"" in sound option. 5) Amazon Prime, Hotstar and Netflix can watch without any issues after update of Android. But the wifi net should be high-speed to enjoy the High quality streaming. Overall a very best TV in this price. I give 4.5 star out of 5.",Best TV with 1080p display,B07XK9JSGY

Sound & picture quality good.. New brand VU.. Great features in this price range.. Amazon delivery & installation is good (On Time) Competitive quality Against MI TV.,Best on this price,B07XK9JSGY
Bought a 43 inch variant as I needed a secondary tv. It's been a week now and I'm totally satisfied with the purchase. Was a bit disappointed when amazon prime refused to sign me in even after multiple attempts. Did some research and reset the tv from home screen - settings and wolla! Prime works like a charm now. Good buy for the price point. Extended warranty of 2 yrs is available through vu for a very reasonable price!,Good buy,B07XK9JSGY
Amazon and VU trying to fool the customers. The advertisement for this TV having Amazon prime everywhere but it won't work on this TV.,Why Amazon,B07XK9JSGY
Quality of the TV is nice and has very good options in this low cost. I am unable to sign in the pre-installed prime video app and when asked the prime video support team they informed me that currently VU tv is not supported for Prime Video. Then why the amazon advertising the prime video app with the main picture of the tv and with pre-installed app. Useless app finally...,Good Quality and nice options...,B07XK9JSGY

"Avoid buying from amazon Vu 43"" ultra android tv is a good buy at 21k and value for money, the picture quality and sound quality are good at this price. Also it comes with stock Android 9. The only issue which I have faced is prime video not working properly (which resolved through an update by proactive support from vu customer care) though has separate option in remote and mentioned in offering. It also sometimes responds a bit slow to remote actions. Unless you are ok with spending hours explaining issues to Amazon customer care executives one after another don't buy it from amazon, supposedly there is a large appliance customer care team which, as per my experience, is pathetic. Sharing the issues I have faced so that you are well aware of challenges when you buy any large appliance from Amazon: Installation: The installation guy has not come at the scheduled slot with no information. I was supposed to keep waiting for him. Once the waiting time (1.5 hours) is over I had to spend 3 hours explaining the issue to Amazon customer care, with no resolution. Supposedly there are different teams and call will get transferred to different executives and keep waiting on music (you would be asked to receive a call back from chat executive) and explaining the issue again and again. Finally, they told me they are unable to help. Installation guy came to my place 10 days after the tv delivery. Warranty: Though there was free extended warranty from acko as per the offer when I bought the tv. I have not recieved any information regarding the same. I had contacted Amazon customer care regarding the same and again faced the same pattern. After spending one hour ten mins explaining the issue to different executives I was asked to call again after few hours. Knowing the final response and the hastle I have to go though with Amazon large appliance customer care, I have decided to forget about the extended warranty. I believe a good number of frustrated customers may not follow up for warranty.",Vu ultra Android TV is good but don't buy from amazon,B07XK9JSGY
"Very happy to see its performance. Trust me it has Outstanding picture quality and inbuilt surround sound. Highly recommend to new buyer. This was 2nd time i purchase vu. 1st one is 3yr old and this recently in oct'19. Reviewed after 4day usage. New buyer don't worry if sound seems echo, pls change setting & u'll get clear sound from speaker. Installation service is pathetic.

Ultra Android VU TV newly lauched is ultra bad. Remote has dedicated prime button but prime not supported. Google assistant app present in the TV...no voice support on remote. Service engineer has no knowledge. Unable to explain any features. TVS e service providers should train n update the engineers. 24*7 Amazon prime customer service is unable to resolve the issues.

"Purchased during recent Great Indian Sale (40 Inches), Pros: 1. Excellent Picture Quality with Full HD. 2. Sound Quality is quite sufficient for a large living room. 3. Wide viewing angle. 4. 5 Start Power consumption. 5. Most of the paid subscription Apps works after the initial firm ware upgrade. 6. Built-in dedicated Keys helps in switching to apps with ease. Cons: 1. Remote or TV doesn't support voice commands, requires an additional device. 2. Typing with remote is a bit awkward, QWERTY keypad on remote would help a lot.",Excellent Choice,B07XK9JSGY

"Best High end android TV in this range. Android 9 OS Hotkeys for Netfix, prime, YouTube & Google Play (though Amazon prime is having login issue). Picture quality is very good even without 4K screen. Sound quality is also good. No issue faced till now in connectivity ( WiFi, Bluetooth or USB all works absolutely fine). Absolutely flawless screen cast from mobile. Patch wall is simple and easy to use. Around 5GB free internal memory. So far so Good.. Customer case is little slow but OK. No smart remote.

It is my first experience of VU tv and i wanted to say that i donot know how is the picture quality and etc because there is no installation happened from 2nd Oct. I never thought buying a TV would be so painful. I repent I would have purchased Other renowned brands like Sony or Samsung for that matter. I donot when will the installation happen neither Amazon is able to help. Real bad experience. Complete disappointment.,No review because installation has not happened since many a days now,B07XK9JSGY
"I'll address the Amazon PrimeVideo problem first and it's solution. Initially the registration of device was not happening it's a software issue. Solution: Update the TV software. Settings-Device Preferences-About-System update. After its done prime video will work for most but I had trouble even after update. Then I did a reset (last option in Device Preferences) and it solved my issue. Hope this will help others. Picture, Audio and overall performance is great and great value for money. The customer care side of VuTv needs improvement.",Amazon Prime Video Solution,B07XK9JSGY
Sound quality is not good,It’s ok,B07XK9JSGY
Bought this TV for my parents (mainly). Best Display in this segment (for those who watch SD channels) Speakers are good (no need to buy external sound system unless you are sound freak) Only 45 watts of power (energy saving) Android 9 (for my use) (Note : i am writing this on installation day. I will review after 4 months of use),This product is for those who know exactly what they want in TV,B07XK9JSGY
"Initially i had problem with prime video but now its working like everything. For users having issue with amazon prime, they need to reset their tv.... Thats all. After trying all methods available, customer service asked me to reset the tv and its worked. Just go to setting------device preference-----reset. Remember do not signin with your Google account ( you can do later after prime registration done successfully). Picture quality is superp and videos are sharp and well balanced. Dolby atmos really works and sound is loud enough for my room. Sound is enough even at at 25 - 30 percentage. Impressed with the built quality, easy to setup. Best tv in this budget with Android 9 and with amazon prime support. Customer support is also very quick. I opted this against mi tv and i am happy with my decision.",Promising product from VU.,B07XK9JSGY
Amazing picture and sound quality for the price however Prime Video does not work Yes it does not work. Returned after breaking my head on how to run Prime Video even after the TV has dedicated button on the remote and it's a preloaded app. What a time waste.,Prime Video does not work,B07XK9JSGY
"For all those whose in built Ch'cast isn't working just change country from USA to India. About the tv. At third of a price compared to known brands with similar features, you simply get what you pay for. Absence of a voice remote irks but considering the performance of the Google app you might as well not have it. Picture is blindingly super bright. I have no idea why the emphasis on bright by all brands. You aren't going to use this in sunlight ... Duh On the brighter side (no pun there lol) the colours produced are very accurate. A piece of advice. Don't judge it by the dth performance. Judge it by playing some good online content. Colours are generally warm and well, getting adjusted from a pana tv the motion seems jerky to me. Sound is loud enough but at times the speakers can't handle the bass and distortion is more than evident. OS is stock android. And well, stock Android always works best, in my opinion that is. Looks... Really nice. It looks really nice, for the price , yes pretty much. Quality... For starters have a look at the picture shared there is something actually sticking out on the left bottom part of the screen ROFL.

"Amazon and installation team did a good job in delivering(10th) and installing the TV as per schedule on 11-10-2019.Thanks. Coming to performance of the tv, it coonected well with WiFi. Not yet tried other smart TV features The picture quality is not good for a FHD TV. Color reproduction is not good with pink skin tone, smudged picture, no sharp pictures. Quite surprised to note that It is like a early vintage CRT TV. Not able to identify distant objects in the screen. Sound is good with stereo and surround sound working well. But, loud annoying sound alerts while scrolling down any menu items in picture modes, sound styles and other settings is a cause of concern. It's only one day after delivery. Watch for 2/3 days and if the performance of the tv doesn't improve, think of returning for exchange. Now after checking it's is found that it's resolution is not 1920X1080. It's only 1280X720p. Not Full HD. Any takers.","Vu 40"" ultraandroid LED TV Average quality not Full HD. It's 720p.",B07XK9JSGY

First VU TV and its very impressive. As Usual amazon is the best when it comes to delivery and products. Box contains wall mount as well as stand. The Display panel is what impress me the most.

The spoken voices in movies are very less audible and the background music is almost twice loud at same volume. If i want to hear the dialogues properly, then the music score blasts through the TV. Can someone help me with this ? Tried almost all settings. Will give 5 star if problem is solved.",VU TV Review,B07XK9JSGY
"Pro 1.Sound volume is good but quality is not. 2.Ease of Connectivity is good. 3. Picture Brightness and Contrast are good when viewed right from front (90deg) 4. Composite ports and USB ports responding well but USB 1 is not recognised. Cons 1. Disappointing point is the picture quality when vied from an angle.Against claims of 178deg viewing angle, the quality goes on deteriorating as the angle increases and at 178deg it is bad. 2.The operating Manual is too concise. Just passing mention about Chromecast, Bluetooth etc and if one is not already some sort of an expert, it will be difficult. Overall Fair quality. Value for money.",Overall good,B07XK9JSGY
"This review is edited after about a week of use. Good picture quality, decent sound quality. Best of all, excellent value for money esp with the exchange of my old TV. Earlier, I had Netflix, YouTube working fine but I had mentioned that Amazon Prime I wasn't able to sign in, due to some bug. I got an email from Vu detailing the procedure to ensure that Amazon Prime also works. I had to reset to default settings, but after that Amazon Prime has also started working. So all is fine now The delivery was on time, but the installation was delayed by about a week and took several follow ups. But was finally done well.",Very good,B07XK9JSGY
Good picture quality & fast installation,Wealth of mony,B07XK9JSGY
"The TV is competitively priced with attention to detail in design. An example is during the installation, I noticed that they have taken good care that in a case of wall mount, the mount does not damage the wall & hence some cushion has been provided along. The only which could be improved is the speed. I felt the TV was a bit slower as compared to my other TV although this does not affect the viewing experience & Hotstar takes a long time to load. I am not sure if this is specific to my TV but nothing major as well. Overall a good product in affordable price. I had issues with the installation from Amazon & after escalation, VU themselves made sure the TV is installed on time & checked with me if I am satisfied with the service. That is a really great after sales experience not so common across other brands I use. The person from VU who did the installation was also extremely good & had a good understanding with the installation. The Picture & sound quality is no doubt good for the price. Overall a very pleasant experience so far.",A TV worth the money,B07XK9JSGY
"The amazon prime issue is solved by doing a factory reset of the tv. This Tv has decent build quality, picture quality and most of the features you would require factoring in the price you pay. However, what bothers me the most is the poor sound quality. It distorts with a jarring effect whenever there is any sound with bass in it, for example background music, loud noises etc. This happens not only on high volume but on low volume as well as well. The sound comes off as boxy and annoying. Have tried different sound setting as well but can't seem to resolve the issue. Not sure if this problem is being faced by everyone or for my tv alone hence am going to ask for a replacement. Update 1: The Technician that Amazon sent to check the TV has now confirmed that there is a functional problem with the sound of the TV and it needs to be replaced. However, after many phone calls with Amazon customer care they are now telling me that the option to replace the TV is not appearing in their backend system and there is only an option for initiating a refund. However, a refund is not the solution for me as the price for the same model has now gone up by 1500/- on Amazon (from the same seller, Cloudtail), so I can't repurchase the same model at the price I paid. All this while they were assuring me that the TV would be replaced if a fault was found but are now saying that they can only refund the amount paid as the TV is not in stock with the vendor. This is not true as it is still available on the Amazon site through the same vendor albeit at a higher price i.e. 19999/- (instead of 18499/-, which is the amount I paid for it). Since all of this is no fault of mine I do hope they are able to resolve this issue amicably without further delay Update 2: Finally received a replacement for the TV a few days back. But was suspicious as it did not come in the type of packaging as the first TV I received (no protective plastic covering on the outside of the box). Once the technician opened the box to install the same we found out it was a used TV as there was no protective plastic covering the TV inside the box as well, the TV was just placed inside the box with the accessories. The remote batteries were already inside the remote and once the TV was switched on it went directly to the viewing screen without going through any setup. Add to all this the sound issue persisted in this TV as well so had no option but to return the same for a refund. Please be aware that Amazon is recirculating these TVs and hence their customers must make sure that they are infact receiving a new/unused piece. This has been one of the few times I've had a bad experience with Amazon but hopefully they look into the matter.",Very poor sound quality and used TV given as replacement,B07XK9JSGY

"The product is very good ... delivery was prompt by Amazon as usual !! The picture quality as well as sound quality is pretty good for the price and the Smart TV features work well !! The latest Android pie as the OS delivered a smooth experience, the TV remote is responsive and having direct buttons for Netflix, Prime Video, YouTube, Hotstar as well as Google Play helps immensely. Bluetooth connectivity is a boon for connecting wireless headphones etc, Casting your phone works pretty well ... etc. etc. Lot of good features that I found useful. I did compare many similar TV's before buying this one, and am not at all disappointed with my decision till date. I would have loved to have 3 HDMI connections, but that is only a minor miss I would say. This is not my main TV (that is a bigger and high-end TV) so I am not comparing the two, I have a fair understanding and appreciation of AV, hence in my judgement this is a very good TV at this price point (maybe better than some products at a little higher price points than this. I would recommend !!",Very good quality and feature rich TV for the price !,B07XK9JSGY

"The whole experience with the TV is really good. Amazing picture clarity and sound output is commendable. All the apps works perfectly except Prime Video which is a bummer. Amazon says that the TV is not supported. Not sure why they advertise that it support Prime Video. VFM product if you don't mind the issue with Prime Video. *****Edit***** Changing my rating to 5 Stars. Prashanth from VU called me up and said that the issue should be fixed by updating the software to the latest version. I updated to the latest one (Sept 16th release). It still didn't work. Prashanth asked me to factory reset once. After doing a factory reset, Prime Video started working. Happy with the service and happy with the product. :)",Amazon Prime Video doesn't work. *Edit* It worked after a factory reset,B07XK9JSGY
"When I purchased it, I was facing trouble in casting tv with my phone, and zee5 was not working properly, But both problems resolved with first software update. + video quality is good, the sound is loud and clear. UI is good. The problems I can see now is: Half star lost here. 1. The missing feature is: no mic/ voice button on remote + voice feature does not work, you can only type key by key using remote which is very hectic thing, when you could just speak and get things types on screen. Below mentioned 2 points are negligible and can be ignored or might be fixed in upcoming releases. 2. amazon prime not working, but this is working in the Casting feature. 3. sound is a little distorted when we surf/move between apps, only that sound is distorted, tv sound is awesome. Build quality- half star lost here. 4. The screen is not 100% fit and taped on corner boundary, I can see light coming out at some places standing parellet to screen, this point I am not considering since we have paid half the price of LG/ Samsung haha. I got this 40-inch device in 18500, 1000 amazon pay cashback I got and 1850 I will get in SBI bank account cashback, So I got it for 15650 :) + plus point is, got both stands with TV, MItv does not wall mount stand, so save of 400 Rs again. + got Acko 1 year extra warranty from Amazon because of Big festival Sale. Earlier I was confused because of a few above points, but casting resolved half of my doubts :) You can buy it without much doubt.",only voice button mic feature is missing in remote,B07XK9JSGY

"Brought Vu premium and Vu UltraAndroid for myself and relatives so here's my short summary. Before getting into the positive I just want to point out the one con i found so far which is the lack fo 3.o Usb ports for the TV it comes with 2 USB 2.0 ports only. Now, Let's get into the picture quality ,the picture quality is really good with good brightness level and contrast. FHD channels looks pretty good too. i don't think you can beat this TV's picture quallity compared to other TVs on a budget, First thing you notice is how well it upscales Videos that are non FHD to look miles better. Espcially when there are still alot of Tv channels in SD,this upscaling feature alone makes the tv worthy along with picture quality. In terms of Android experience it's pretty much Stock android Pie tv experience with occasional lags here and there even high end Android TV's have this issue so not much to complain here. Tv comes with Netflix Amazon prime youtube and hotstar installed with first 3apps getting their own dedicated buttons on the remote . The picture quality through streaming is pretty good too. Coming to the sound quality i found it better then my mi soundbar and prefered to use inbuilt tv speaker.It's got good bass ,clarity and quite loud . Conclusion If you are looking mainly for the picture quality on a budget you should be better going of with this or the non Android VU Ultra Tv for 16k. IF you don't mind spending an extra few thousands you should consider getting the VU premium android 4k not that there are lot of 4k content, but even the FHD channels looks so much better in that tv its more vivid and black levels are deep. Streamed 4k videos though Youtube to my Vu premium the picture quality is great and got great details to it. For full detailed review i found Techiebeez india channel to have good review of this TV.",Probably the Best in-terms of Picture quality for Budget,B07XK9JSGY

"As a TV, it is a good buy. The picture and sound is good. TV design is good but its the software that is a let down. the resolution of home screen etc is a let down. Its not sharp at all. Netflix is working but we are unable to use AMAZON prime ( it is a built in app ). Its much better to buy VU Non Smart tv and purchase a Fire Stick or equi. While that was by earlier review. VU sorted out the problem almost immediately and they definitely deserve a mention and a pat on the back. Seems like my SMART TV is SMART once again. We are more than satisfied with the software now that all our grievance have to looked into. I would not only recommend the tv for the display and sound, but also VU as a brand that is Prompt in AFTER SALES.","Be Smart, Dont buy SMART... unless its a VU.",B07XK9JSGY
"This is my 3rd VU tv have moved to VU from brands like Sony and LG and this brand has never disappointed me. Best part is the picture quality, colours are very vivid. On comparing to my cousin's MI tv I found the picture quality to be far better. Now people are running towards features but at the end of the picture quality is something which impacts your experience the most. So advice is to save money go for this product with extended warranty and enjoy peace of mind.",Another great product form VU,B07XK9JSGY

"It is not a matured android tv. Problems:- 1) Unable to do initial configurations with mobile,it simply does not connect to it so need to enter app login credentials through on screen key board which is cumbersome to do with tv remote. 2) Every time there is a new firmware update it simply gets reset so now you need to start initial configs again. Do hotstar,amazone prime,google, Zee4 .... and several other app registration again and yeah you need to download them again. 3) remote does not have voice recognition. 4) Bottom clamp stands are wide and slightly bent outwards so u need a sufficiently bigger table if using table mount. 4) When using screen cast it lags in display, so when you swipe to next picture on your phone it will display the next pic on tv screen after about 5 seconds. Forget about HD videos. Okok:- Screen and colour quality is acceptable at this cost. Sound is also normal.",Not a matured android TV.,B07XK9JSGY
"i ordered the tv on 29th sep 2019 and received on 5th oct and installed on 6th oct. the installation guy installed the tv and shown me some operations. after that i started using the tv . i purchased this tv because this tv directly support prime video and hotstar and hot keys given on remote it self. i tried to open hotstar but failed . after lot of brain storming i decided to download the app and i did the same it gave me a code to verify i followed the procedure and enjoying it. no problems the same thing happened with zee 5 alsso now the real story starts now i am not able to open prime video. it is asking me sign in , i did the same and it gave me a code and with that code i registered my tv. then it allowed me browse the content. when i am opening some movie it is not at all opening and saying about some error and suggesting contact prime video help. but i could not get any help from that. finally i thought if i update the software i may find some solution. it 1 hour for me how to update it. finally i updated it and i am able to watch from prime video. but very very frustating point is if you switch off the tv and again you have to re login and verify your tv . this is very very frustating to me so far i made near about 15 login it is not happening with any other app, why it is happening with prime video . i hope vu and amazon prime video will resolve this problem at the earliest. here i am attaching 5 photos regarding how to update. finally i am giving only four stars and cutting one star with respect to prime video app. let me check the remaining apps after that i will come back",a good tv with annoying prime video app,B07XK9JSGY

"Almost all the points were covered in other reviews from various customers. I don't want to repeat them again. Based on my usage from one week I felt picture clarity is very good, sound is also good. no need to separate speakers unless you want high woofer effects. I had faced issue with promevideo like many other users. I was able to resolve it by resetting the settings. Thanks for the solution by some users in the reviews section. Another issue which I am facing is with Jio cinema. I have installed the Jio Cinema app from the playstore. But I am not able to open the app. I am getting the error, unable to process the request, please try again later. Also I am not able to do casting also from jio cinema app from my mobile. I thought this issue also will be resolved after the system reset. But it didn't. If anybody is facing the similar issue and found any solution, please update.

Secondly I've gone through all negative reviews and compared it with my TV, unfortunately none of them are valid, Prime is perfectly registered and we finished watching 2 full movie as well. But yes couple of vital things are missing ""Mic enabled remote"" and ""Bluetooth"" with some hiccups here and there but eventually the product is phenomenal in my 2 days experience.",Good TV for its price tag,B07XK9JSGY

Excellent smart TV at a very affordable rate. The TV is better than I expected with full functionality. I am thinking of buying same with a bigger screen for another room though I do not require.

"Bought this 32"" Android TV during Dussehra Sale for a meagre amount which was little less than even 10K. Firstly it was delivered well on time and When I opened the package, I was impressed with the looks. Installation itself is damn easy and I mounted it on the wall. Picture quality, sound quality is awesome and ease of configuring the set with your mobile and broadband is extremely user friendly. The remote has user-friendly keys for direct access to Amazon prime, Netflix, hotstar, YouTube and Google Play. It can be connected by HDMI, USB , cables and even with the phones using MIRACAST. The response to Internet is crisp and overall it's a value for money. I presume that customer support mechanism too should be good because I received mails and phone calls ascertaining about the product satisfaction. Overall an economical buy wherein at this cost you hardly get a decent phone.",Value for Money and loaded with features,B07XK9JSGY

"**This is a genuine review posted by a genuine Customer** Placing Order: I have placed the order during the great Indian festival and got a discount on the original price. I have purchased this TV for 21000. I have also opted out for Acko Insurance. Delivery: I live in a city which is connected by railways and transport very well with the major cities like Hyderabad and Banglore. As the seller cloudtail shipped my product from Greater thane I was pretty sure that I will get delivery within 3 days. But that did not happen. Due to the ongoing sale and Diwali holidays, I have received the product after 8 days.Amazon delivered the product within the deadline. First Impression: After the delivery, I have unboxed the TV and put it on the stand given in the box. The setup of the tv is not that difficult as it is an Android TV. After the whole setup, I quickly jumped to the video quality Video: Video quality is better than LG and close to Samsung. Brightness is slightly high but it won't bother you if you are not going to stick to the premium led panels expectations. Audio: Audio quality has impressed me. It is better than the premium rivals. The 20W output is good enough for 10 feet distance. Speed: As it is an android tv, it comes with inbuilt RAM and storage. The 1 GB ram will keep you wait for 30 seconds when you press on from your remote. After 30 seconds the home screen appears. Once you get started there is no such delay in operations. Interface: Interface is stock android and customizable. Connectivity: Wifi, Bluetooth and USB ports works very well Remote: You can handle the majority of tasks using remote and remote has soft textured keys. Installation: For the installation, I had to call VU customer care to place an installation request. The installation guy came after 1day. He was skilled enough to mount the TV properly. I have found VU customer care good enough till now. Overall Comment: I personally think that as my budget was within 25000 rupees and I wanted a tv with youtube and Full HD capabilities, this one is a good choice and my family doesn't watch the TV whole day. It's a good tv and I suggest this tv if you have a budget within 25000 but don't expect too much like sony or any premium brand as you are buying a product considering the price point. I found this TV fulfilling all my needs. I have chosen this TV over price and I am very satisfied with my choice. I didn't want to purchase a TV worth 44K just to watch for 1 hour. Overall I will rate this TV 4 stars. If brightness is adjusted and some more RAM is given then I would have might give it 5 stars.",I Am Satisfied With My Choice,B07XK9JSGY

When we increase volume the audio started to distort when ever watching movie background music and sound started to mix and can't able to hear that sound. 2. Front pannel is not well placed in it. It's cause of the company cheap quality of plastic that they have used in television the front bezels are coming off due to which the light leaks this is with all vu televisions as i replaced it with another and found same defect in it .

"Initially i was hesitant to buy VU brand. But this is for my parents , the were using old CRT TV.so wanted to upgrade it. Confusion between vu,MI,micromax,tcl and Santo. But many social media ppl replied with VU tv with half mind. Even i got offer for LV TV around 13k. But already i had LG TV, it was having diplay issue. Every 2 years, inside led plastics fell off. And spent 5000 every two years. So i don't want to go for LG brand. And ordered this vu android latest TV. Since it's new to the market, I didn't get many reviews. With half minded i ordered. Tv reached earlier than expected (remote village in Tamilnadu).. But installation didn't happen at scheduled time. 4 days later. So i saw my TV installed 2 days back only. Its not HD but HD Ready. But quality of video is perfect HD for 32 inches. Played Netflix and YouTube videos seamlessly... Many ppl reviewed other VU branda having low volume...no... Its sound volume is more than expected. For my family its enough. Dolby effect also gud . ( if u need more effect pls go for home theatre) Netflix, hotstar and YouTube with remote buttons, we can get easily. ( in hotstar i couldn't able to select subtitles) I reduced one star because, amazon prime button in remote. But its having login issues. Even though we registered out TV in amazon page, I can't run amazon prime in this TV. But its having Inbuilt Chromecast. So u can cast all from ur mobile to TV. Now i can't tell abt durability, but its worth for every penny... I think VU is cheap and best. Simply go for it ❤❤❤❤",Good and budget TV. Must buy if u need good issue logfing smart TV,B07XK9JSGY
"Absolutely brilliant! I was little skeptical about buying it since it was offering so much for so little. Its a 32 inch smart tv which offers great colours and contrast and surprisingly the white balance offered is good at this price. Sound quality is fine though not great. Smart TV features are working smoothly (youtube, Amazon prime, sonyliv ) i had no issues while launching applications or while streaming them infact i can compare it with my firestick which i have for my other room. It also has a blutooth receiver as well The build quality is more than acceptable. It doesn't feel clumsy at all, the provided Remote is also sturdy and its buttons are responsive. The only thing which is at the downside is the OSD menu which could have been better in terms of screen positioning and the user interface ... Anybody who wants to buy a smart tv should not think twice ..just go for it ! Its a steal at the current discounts and offers ..",Simply Awesome,B07XK9JSGY

Pairing easy with blutooth devices. Jio cimema supported. Cons: Volumen is loud, but 100% clear. This does not mean it will impact voice, buy this without any hesitation. No blutooth remote which is necceessary now a days. Its not there i guess in any of the size i guess but not sure. ChromeCast does not work very well.

"Review after first OTA update on October 9th 2019. I have been using the 32 inch android tv for a week now. The picture quality is amazing. Its an android tv so one has access to all important apps. Netflix, Prime video, hotstar, youtube among others. Users have been facing issue with accessing primevideo, but the latest Ota update solves the problem. Just update and do a factory reset. Viola it works! The sound is decent as well. You can pair bluetooth headset as well. The inbuilt speakers are also decent for a small room. Over all a quality tv for the price. Go for it.",Brilliant and prime video now works!,B07XK9JSGY

Pros Android Tv at affordable cost. Super from VU tv. Cons: No Remote Voice Assistant. Edit: VU customer service is awesome. They did everything to ensure my tv experience is good. They earned a loyal customer today. Amazon Prime works after recent OTA update. Updating my review from 2 to 5 after all what VU team did to ensure my satisfaction.,Best Android TV after OTA update patch,B07XK9JSGY
"Everything is fine except Amazon prime video is not working, when I reached Amazon prime support they said that they didn't release compatible version for VU TVS yet, they suggested that keep on update VU software frequently, it will be available soon. I am disappointed on this issue, except this all is well.",Amazon Prime issue on VU TV,B07XK9JSGY
Leaving this review after a week of use. Good tv ...connectivity is good ... buitin Chromecast is good ... No issues in connectivity. Sound is good. Differnet modes for different types of modes. Buit in apps work fine though Amazon Prime gets disconnected sometimes however i can always chromecast it from phone so no worries there. All in all a good TV and i am very happy with the performance so far,Amazing Smart TV at Amazing price,B07XK9JSGY
"I bought this after comparing it with many other branded TVs such as Samsung, Xiaomi, LG, Motorola, etc. But finally decided to buy this because it's an Indian brand and the features and quality it offers are comparable to those Big brands as Samsung and LG and can easily beat Chinese made TVs in terms of display and sound quality & clarity. I recommend this TV to all those who are in a tight budget but want a really good picture quality and sound in a TV that too from an Indian Brand. Also latest Android 9.0, Bluetooth 5.0 and Chromcast works very well. The interface is easy to operate. Also, you get five shortcut keys for each streaming media (Hotstar, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Youtube) in remote itself, so no hassle. I faced no connectivity issues so far. As far as voice control is concerned, one can use their smartphones to operate their tv via Google Assistance, you just need to download the Google assistance app and apply settings to it.",Best Offering from an Indian Brand.,B07XK9JSGY
Product is good but installation and costumes care is worst. Not see the performance of the TV yet so cant say about performance of the TV,Worst costomer care and installation of VU,B07XK9JSGY
"40"" Bought in 16010/- (with icici discount). Amazon allow to check product with ""free open box verification"" which is really helful. Nice picture clarity, good contrast ratio, there is li'l bit vibrating voice/music on high volume, 1080i videos plays smoothly. But wait.... there is lot of hectic for installation. My TV has been installed after 19 days from the product delivery. after 1 time service man refuse to came due to traffic and 2 times VECARE (amazon's vendor) appoint the service man which was not belongs to my area. VECARE is the worst service i have ever experieced in my life. And.... don't forgot to extend warranty.",TV Quality is better with compare to its price but needs to strong follow up for Installation.,B07XK9JSGY

"Picture quality is very good, sound is very very good , connectivity is super",Awesome product,B07XK9JSGY
"I got the 40 inch Vu Smart android TV and it is just awesome at this price. I bought it in amazon sale. Initially all the apps(Netflix, Youtube, Hotstar, Zee5) were working fine expect prime video which was disappointing but the installation guy installed some update of 840 MB, reset the TV settings and then all apps were working smoothly. The clarity is amazing and is visible clearly from any angle. Though I was not impressed with the sound but that can be ignored as most of the TV's do not have awesome sound. I have compensated that with JBL soundbar and now its superb experience for me. For this price range this Vu TV fulfills all the criteria and if you want are planning to buy go for this.",Very nice for this price range.,B07XK9JSGY
"It's been 10 days and so far my experience with VU Ultra Android range has been phenomenal. The picture quality is really vibrant and vivid. The colours are perfect in this range. The display is far better than it's competitors and also the colours seem pretty natural. Coming to the sound section, the 20W surround sound Dolby system is absolutely mind blowing. The voice is clear and the music just mellows your ears. The bass and everything is pretty good and at this price point everything works phenomenal. Netflix works perfectly. Every other Android supported application runs the same. The Chromecast feature also works flawlessly. The only issue I have faced is with Amazon Prime video. The TV supports the app. But the app has not been registered with Vu TVs till now. So registering of the device doesn't work. So using amazon video works currently with Chromecast feature only. Apart from this everything is perfect.",Best Smart TV under 20k,B07XK9JSGY
"The picture quality is not up to the mark, may be I chose wrong, that crispyness is missing, Resolution is poor, picture sometimes fades, should HV bought high resolution model. Sound quality is good. Open if VU can provide me higher model withore resolution",Above average product,B07XK9JSGY
"After update, Amazon Prime videos is working",Amazon Prime videos,B07XK9JSGY
"Writing this review after using this tv for 15 days. Its picture quality and sound quality is great. All apps are working great. Chromecast also working flawlessly. We have to watch HD content, SD content from cable network not that much good. With good amount of data plan or broad band connection we can enjoy every moment with this TV without any cable connection.",Complete package with all boxes ticked,B07XK9JSGY
"The product is as per our desire. It comes with all the advance features at affordable price. VU issues - None of the installation person turned up despite multiple dates offered and followup. Too bad service, complete dissatisfaction. Only Problem area : 1) Wifi link disables multiple times. Then we need to struggle going in setting 2) QWERT Keyboard remote to be shared. It takes long time to type 3) Sound quality is ok, since we have Sony 5.1 channel we enjoy the sound effects. Gives you a theatre feel",Quality product at affordable price,B07XK9JSGY
"Overall happy with the product. It is very less in price compare to other products with same features in market. Overall a good deal. Only thing that I feel missing is voice recognization in remote. Amazon app is still ot working even with the patch. But it still serves the purpose, I am very happy with purchase in this low budget.",Its a very good deal in this price,B07XK9JSGY
"Its the first time that i have ordered an electronic item and was little skeptical about the order and delivery, When i received the product and now that its wall mounted - Picture quality is great and so is the sound quality - AS its my first smart TV was little confused about the process - But the services that was provided did exceed my expectations - Good Job !!!!",VU 43 Inch Smart TV,B07XK9JSGY
"THE PICTURE QUALITY IS AWESOME. THE CLARITY IS SUPERIOR THAN OTHERS IN COMPETITION. THE TV IS VERY SLIM AND LIGHT WEIGHT AND HAS ALL THE SMALL ACCESSORIES LIKE BRACKET WITH THE TV SET. VOICE QUALITY IS VERY GOOD . LISTENING TO LOUD MUSIC IS JUST A JOY WITH THIS TV AS IF U FEEL LIKE IN THERATRE .THE INSTALLATION WAS SO EASY THAT ANY LAY PERSON CAN EASILY INSTALL THE TV. THE DIRECT BUTTONS ON REMOTE FOR NETFLIX,AMAZON PRIME, HOTSTAR, YOUTUBE ARE VERY GOOD FEATURE. I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH THE PRODUCT AND WOULD RECOMMEND OTHERS TO USE THE VU TV..BEING NEW AND NOT MUCH KNOWN COMPANY .INITAILLY I WAS RELUCTANT TO BUY.. BUT I HAD GIVEN A TRY AND FOUND TO BE REALLY THE GOOD QUALITY TV WITH LOW COST..",VERY GOOD QUALITY TV WITH LOW COST... A GOOD PRODUCT TO BUY,B07XK9JSGY
"The Vu 80 cm Android TV is working satisfactorily. The price was very reasonable. Only negative point is that even at a distance of around 30 feet from the wifi modem (Airtel Broadband with reasonably good download speed), sometimes it takes time to get a very clear picture , also buffering delay",Value for money,B07XK9JSGY
"Pictures quality is good,sound is just ok. System take updates after installation automatically when contented with wifi. Everything work fine but Problem is os system running very slow. Tv home page takes 15 sec to come after click on button otherwise it's a good tv. Vu modified ultra smart tv to ultra Android. That's all",Good enough..,B07XK9JSGY
"Still am using 3 weeks so first upol pros 1) Superr bright picture quality. 2) It supports hotstar,YouTube, Netflix all other apps. 3) value for money. Cons. 1) sound quality is just normal. 2) this tv miss matching the sound and picture when playing Bluetooth divices and sound systems. 3) VU not provide voice remote. 4) casting feature also miss match sound and picture. 5) When strating the tv it taking1more minutes to take booting.",Nice tv,B07XK9JSGY
"The installer came and gave a quick demo but was not equipped to activate the voice recognition feature. Hence I have given a blank rating on that. The screen cast / mirroring experience is pathetic. The audio is immediately casted from my Android phone to the TV, but the pictures follow after a delay of over 20 secs. I have absolutely no delay when I use a Chromecast device cast fitted on a normal (non-Smart) Sanyo TV over the same wi-fi network. The users manual is also below expectation. It does not even mention the exact model of the TV set purchased. So I am left wondering whether they made a packing mistake or just don't care about perfection.","Promised a world class experience, but fell short",B07XK9JSGY
"Nice TV with Android 9 out of the box.Netflix,Hot star & YouTube are working fine, however struggling with Amazon prime... Able To cast however the inbuilt app doesn't work. Awesome Display with good brightness and clarity. Placed as second TV in bedroom and it has very nice stereo speakers with awesome sound and watching movies was fun with clear dialogues. First VU TV and its very impressive. As Usual amazon is the best when it comes to delivery and products. Box contains wall mount as well as stand. The Display panel is what impress me the most. The panel used is definately of high grade with awesome clarity. Let's see how VU perform in long run.",Great,B07XK9JSGY
"Highly Disappointed with installation service after 16 days they called for same. I rejected and installed by own. Remote does not support voice feature, could be better. Screen cast for samsung phones is bit tough. Casting device and TV should be on same wifi network. Overall TV is very good and I'm Happy.",Good TV at this price,B07XK9JSGY

Worst tv in terms of quality. Installation never happened and we did ourself. Returned the TV,Worse Amazon service and quality,B07XK9JSGY
This is the best deal you can get from an Indian market at your budget. It's to have a 43 inch TV at this affordable price. One thing I am still worried about is that I am unable to screen share/connect my iPhone to Vu TV. It would be great if the manufacturer shares any docs to do the same. The rest all is great with them. Thanks!,Best deal for Android Indian TV,B07XK9JSGY

"The main disappointment is that VU TV doesn't support Prime Video app as stated by the listing on Amazon. Amazon claims that VU Tv is not supported for prime Video. If yes, why list it in the first place? Very misleading. After multiple calls to VU and Amazon, am using a Fire Stick for apps like Prime Video, Sony LIV. For the price it is a good buy. Proper delivery and installation by Amazon. Kudos to that!",Smart TV - Not so smart.,B07XK9JSGY

"When VU launched in India with LCD screen, i was impressed by there picture quality during that time. My First LCD was from VU which didn't gave issue for good 7 Years. After that it started giving LCD panel issue and went blank. Since Technologies changed LED gave better quality i thought to go for the VU LED TV. These was the second from VU, which i bought 2 years back. Today as i Write this second VU product gave the same issue, LED Panel display has gone blank. When the VU technician visit to check the issue, the option given is to replace the Display Panel. Which cost equivalent to new one. Also they have scripted answer, with Humidity /moisture this are common issues. I read some of the blogs this is one of the common issue reported by other user. With 2 experience by now the hefty cost for repair, i would recommend anyone to please give a second thought before buying VU products and life span of display. As on today VU have discontinued both the products which I had bought.",VU LCd/LED Panel has poor lifespan,B07XK9JSGY

It's a beautiful looking TV, Picture Quality is life like (at recommend viewing distant), Sound is ample enough to fill a room with crisp and clear output (don't spend money buying a sound bar for this TV) and the apps are pretty Swift and easy to navigate (I mean not as swiftly as you can on your laptop or phones, but you'll get the hang of it). Only miss is the voice control remote, would have saved a lot of time typing the content name and don't even think of the Android TV remote its useless But Overall it's definitely an outright winner in the price range of 20k",It's the Mike Tyson of Smart HD TV in budget,B07XK9JSGY
