"Today, it got delivered. Talked to Amazon Customer Service - Due to its cheap build-up quality, I wanted to return this TV (even at this price range its pathetic). Amazon denied to return it. This is the first time(in last 3 years), it ever happened with me on Amazon. I feel cheated and I will make sure Amazon will also feel the Pain. They aren't the only one in the Market.",Cheap Product with Cheap customer service by Amazon,B06XGWRKYT
"Got it for 20500. First order had to be replaced because of broken screen. Volume is good. Tv is good enough for this price range. Simplistic remote. Plays most formats. Usb are at side in back. Hdmi at the back. Bought it to play my PS3. So no complaints there. Got wall mount but prefer the stand. When I played some movies from blue ray format via USB, the clarity is not that great. But TV HD is good enough as any other TV. Full value for money. Bit heavy at 10 kg. My needs are met so very happy.",Fits the value.,B06XGWRKYT
"Great value and quality compared to other TV brands that are in the market. So far very satisfied with delivery, installation and demo. My suggestion is outer packaging quality should be improve as the package design and quality is inferior than what is used in other TV brands I have received as I feel this would reduce damage to the TV that could happen during transportation. Also free wall mount stand which is an added bonus along with free installation. I have using this for less than a week and so far all is good",Great Value !!!,B06XGWRKYT
"This TV maybe LED as in 'technically LED'. The picture quality is worse than a monitor I bought about 9-10 years ago. The viewing angles are terrible. The technician wall mounted the thing before I checked this. My fault. Now, I can't have a sofa that sits low. The sound quality is below average as well. Even if Kodak had spent Rs 300 on the speakers (reference Bluetooth speakers in smaller packages), they could have got something extremely good. But I suppose that's too much to ask for. I can't complain about the input ports though. Even more expensive models come with less. Edit: Having used it for a couple of weeks, I bumped up the stars by 1 more. It's good for DTH TV (considering the lower broadcast quality). Not so great for movies and such. I'd not subscribe to HD Channels (SD should do fine). 2 month update (or close to): I have an urgent wish from Kodak. The volume levels between 4 and 5 needs to be standardized. 4 is low enough that I need to rely on subtitles and 5 is too high to use when your child is asleep even in another room. Could you fix this through an update? 2 month update: A Kodak technician came over yesterday and looked over the 2 issues I had reported (volume from 4-->5 & picture quality is mostly leaning towards red). He mentioned that all TVs have this problem about the volume. This is not my experience from buying other brands. Regarding the reddish appearance, he mentioned that the panel is only capable of so much. That a 30Hz display will not do much more and I use Soft or Medium settings for Streaming sticks. Personally, I've come to the conclusion that my attempts at resolving these issues are all that I could hope for. I won't be trying any more. Just use it for what best I could for the next couple of years.",Might do for an urgent need. Spend more for a better panel,B06XGWRKYT
I would request everyone please don't buy this product... quality is worst..I have purchased this TV before two months and it is not working now screen has blurred automatically...and after sale service is even Masha Allah..no one is gonna help you out..you will be not able to contact with Kodak...no one will replay your mails... they will take a long time to repair ur TV... Overall experience was too much frustrating.,Worst product...don't purchase it,B06XGWRKYT

"Worked for 15 days. Before last day of scheduled return , picture gone. Returned and got full refund.. Not satisfied with this purchase.",Not satisfactory,B06XGWRKYT
"Out of out performance. After using the TV from last three days the screen is blank and customer care department is not taking any complaint for repair giving reason that I have lost the invoice copy. If I have lost the invoice the company should have there own record of customers. I am using various brands like Sony Bravia tv, Hitachi air conditioner, ifb washing machine but never faced such problem. Harassing",More than expected,B06XGWRKYT
Very bad quality.The service center is good for nothing. No proper response ever. I m trying since one and half month for a part replacement and still the struggle persists.. The product is simple waste of money. Better donate your money to an NGO rather buying any Kodak Daba piece.. zero rating...,Poor quality product,B06XGWRKYT
Worthy product. good service Sound quality good. Picture quality best,Good product,B06XGWRKYT
"Got at a good price. The TV is functioning well. The image is crisp and clear. There are a lot more features to be checked. A star less for not getting any call for installation. Happy to use this, hope it doesn't have any issue. Will update review post a few months of usage.",Bought it because it was reasonable and it was from Kodak. Trust factor.,B06XGWRKYT
"Worst TV ever . Poor quality. Display gone in just 3 month of purchase and the above all no response from the kodak customer care. No revert on mails, customer care call not picked and autodisconncted after holding for 5 to 10 min. Dear Amazon request you to block such type of product on your platform as it's affecting you also as you also could not help in this matter as you also told that we can't do anything till Kodak not responded.",Worst TV ever the poorest after service,B06XGWRKYT

Why to go for high budget costly tv's when we have our Kodak TV range. Me and my father will not go by brand we were checking for 50 inch low budget but reliable and we found Kodak tv and i am really happy with my purchase. Its been 3 months since the purchase so i am wrting this review after usge. My recommendation is to go 100% value for money.,Best and value for money extreemly happy.,B06XGWRKYT
"Buy only if you're capable of installing it on your own.. Don't expect Kodak to install... Product is good, but based on installation delay I hope service will be poor. Still now it's ok for this price, picture quality is medicore.. Sound performance is not up to mark..",No installation,B06XGWRKYT

"Dont purchase this tv,only the price is less. We didn't get any service. 16days before I had register the compliant I didn't get any replay form company side.validity of a Kodak led is 3 months only.",How can we record the programs?,B06XGWRKYT
"Terrible picture quality. I regret this purchase. Stay away. Installation from the Kodak team was 2 weeks late. (fyi it's installed by Ask Jevees, a subsidiary of Flipkart.)",Don't Buy Kodak TVs,B06XGWRKYT
"Kodak had already built a name in photography, so I was sure I wouldn't be disappointed chosing kodak. Pros 1) value for money! For under 25k, this TV is a screaming buy! 2) sound quality is good, loud, clear, does have some disturbance at volumes over 85-90, but you'll never need to put the volume so high. 3) Three power saving modes - lower energy usage 4) very light weight! Can easily move around, lift / relocate 5) 2 years warranty! Which is extendable! Recommend taking an extra year 6) VGA port + hdmi port- so you can connect newer devices plus all your old laptops, and use this as a replacement for laptop screen 7) good picture quality, should be sufficient for most Cons 1) USB ports on the bottom are inaccessible unless TV is lifted up, You'll have to make do with the ones on side - which are accessible with minimal difficulty Would have preferred a more easily accessible solution for usb ports and hdmi Debatable 1) colour - had some issues with colour reproduction especially noticeable with photos - but ok for movies, and videos Mostly needs tweaking with colour /saturation /contrast/brightness,especially with dark scenes Preset modes are not useful 2) smart vs non - smart - I got an android box with a non smart TV, coz the smart tvs have lower specs - ram and storage capacity. I'd suggest the same. I'd suggest getting an amazon fire stick with this. Verdict : go for it, I don't see how the premium models will beat it sufficiently to justify the price","Value for money, recommended",B06XGWRKYT
Please beware that the offer of the fire tv stick is a fraudulent one. the Amazon co is playing very tricky to avoid the customer using the offer...its completely cheat . but the TV is good for the price,Cheating Offer,B06XGWRKYT
As per my experience KODAK TV IS VALUE FOR MONEY but picture quality show more magenta (red) color. Panel quality is not good. Sound is average. I am use this for PC purpose specially 3 HDMI and VGA port. So finally panel and picture quality is upset to me.,Less than expectations.,B06XGWRKYT
"- In this price range, its a good buy. - Sound is loud enough. - Picture quality is fine. No point to compare it with high range TVs. I am happy, as it's best buy over purchasing a LED monitor for laptops.",Good buy,B06XGWRKYT
If you have used any of the top brands like Samsung or sony Don’t go for this Because picture and sound quality is terribly bad For this price point it is still not good I could have gone for 32 inch Sony rather than this 50 inch crap for the same price,Poor picture and sound quality,B06XGWRKYT
Plse don't buy this TV. Kodak Co. Servicing was very poor. They are not installation in proper time after 10days they are installing my TV. And not buy any product in Amazon.,Very bad servicing,B06XGWRKYT
Not a good product. The panel board got damaged within 6 months of use. The service center is slack and outsourced. God knows when do they replace the TV. I am upset. Amazon should push the Kodsk huys to render prompt service.,AV Narayanan from kochi,B06XGWRKYT
if you are looking for a decent led tv with large screen size I would recommend this as a value for money buy. Picture quality is decent enough and it surprisingly it supports almost all video formats which you can play using an usb drive. 1080p videos also play good with nice picture quality. Sound quality is a bit on poorer side and you need to use an extra pair of speakers. Im using this for 2 weeks now and satisfied so far.,Value for money,B06XGWRKYT

"TV was installed by Kodak's representative only after 13 days from the date of delivery. Contacting Kodak Customer care is a nightmare. Always on recorded message. Even if someone answered the call, they simply ask me to wait for a 48 hours or 72 hours more for installation. Do not provide any Service request number. After much persuasion, the TV was finally installed after the expiry of 10 days allowed by Amazon for return. However, the quality of TV is poor. Poor clarity and poor audio. Color is more reddish.

Full HD: for casual use you won't have any problems. Sound quality is a little average, lacks bass - so not great for a large room. For a bedroom or a small to medium living room its perfect.

"The tv is decent value for money. The issue is that the picture is washed out and does not provide the level of clarity I was expecting.

"It's got all the basic features at a good price. Decent quality. Sound is good. Picture color or tone can get drab depending on what video source you are viewing, say streaming. Might help you to know that it DOES have a VGA port at least the piece I received - unlike the pics on the Amazon listing which shows an extra USB port where the VGA port is. The installation through Jeeves service was fine too - but it doesn't include a swivel. You will have to prearrange that, I suppose. I wasn't looking for any fancy features, just anything adequate. From that kind of perspective, a good buy.",Value for money. Got all the basic goodies.,B06XGWRKYT

When I enquired customer service regarding this, their answer was 'Our TV doesn't support .mkv format and supports only .mp4 format'. We are in 2019 and they say it won't support .mkv format. I feel like I am in 2009 when DVD players don't support these formats. They have assured they will talk to management and come up with a solution. Let me see what they are going to do. Installation was very late and it was done 3 weeks after delivery. I contacted customer care several times to get it done.
