Manufacturing damage,Damage tv,B07H7WPV7D
No fake review.. Since it is electronic things so maybe the response will be vary but I had purchased it during Great Diwali sale and having 10% cashback with 10% HDFC discount. As usual the Amazon delivery is on time as scheduled. The greatest achievement is on same day within 6 hrs it has been installed even though it was Sunday. Such fast action I never expected.. really awesome. Now see how the TV works in future but until now it working well and it is beyond Value for Money. Thanks Amazon and Thanks Sanyo/Panasonic.,Excellent LED TV in this price.,B07H7WPV7D
"This TV is brilliant value for money, you get 720p, IPS Panel, LED, 16 watts sound, good viewing angles (for my use it‚Äôs perfect), picture quality and colours are good and the installation request and suppprt is being handled by Panasonic so that‚Äôs good too. I bought this TV recently and for moderate everyday use this is fine, but if you want gaming experience and use it as a HD monitor I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd be happy better buy a full HD tv. Good work Sanyo üëçüëçüëç",Brilliant VFM Product,B07H7WPV7D
"Late delivery by Amazon, but since I wasn‚Äôt in a hurry, it was okay.. now to the tv - very good picture quality, the service by Sanyo (Panasonic) is also amazing.. the sound quality is decent.. if one needs a good tv from a reliable brand at a decent price, this is it..","Good brand, good tv",B07H7WPV7D

"Well at this price point, and with the quality of the picture, I find it one the best TV today while not comparing to Sony. The factor also comes along with Panasonic backing it up and the use of A+ panel, its value for money and the others products with the similar price points did not come anywhere near this one. I have 43 inches Full HD earlier purchased two months back and considering its performance I had ordered it on 7th DEC 18, not surprising to me, this is a good TV and response is brilliant. All good to go on this one.",Find it impressive - Sanyo rocks.,B07H7WPV7D

"Purchased this TV on 12th Oct 2018 to replace a 5 years old LG LCD TV. It was installed immediately after receiving the product in good shape. The picture quality is not vibrant like those in Samsung or Sony. Similarly, sound quality is also average and not enough to make an impact. The USB menu settings are very primitive. Unfortunately, within 1.5 months of use the TV has developed a fault that the speakers stop working after 15mins -1 hrs. No amount of fiddling with the settings will bring back the sound. You have to switch it off for 1 hrs to get the speakers working again. Have emailed Sanyo helpline today and is waiting for them to come and investigate.!",Faulty within just 1.5 months.,B07H7WPV7D
"The product is perhaps better but same couldn't be installed instead of your advise on 16/03/2019 to Pasonic service centre to install within 48 hours after receipt of Sanyo LED TV. Till date i.e.25/03/2019 after receipt of TV on 18/03/2019 couldn't be installed after so many request to Panasonic service center at Bhubaneswar, Odisha.

"Good one, though I pay around 13k for this and same product price reduced to almost 10k during Amazon sale. I should have wait for the sale time. Good product, nothing better at this price range. If you raised your budget little bit then Mi TV is best. For installation Videocon guy will come. This created confusion between both parties as he also did not aware about the product brand. Later came again after consulting with their service center. They have tie up with Videocon.",Good one,B07H7WPV7D
"Bought this TV for Shop, but unfortunately this is wastage of money. Colors are very very off, very faded, no real color. Picture is noise when using both HDMI and AV cable together for 2 different input. Nothing visible if outside bright sunlight, as i am using it on shop. Amazon customer service also pathetic, they say we can't do anything if product is bad, that's your problem, should have checked if this is cheap TV compare to Samsung then you will only get this kind of picture. (Even though the resolutions they show are equal to Samsung TV) Not expected such kind of customer care from Amazon team.","Picture quality very poor, nothing visible when viewing from side angle",B07H7WPV7D

"I am writing this review after using this TV for the past 2 months. Over all I should say that I am fairly satisfied with the Product considering the money that I paid for it. I use it extensively with Amazon Firestick in HD mode which gives a very decent picture from viewing distance of around 5 feet. Pros: - Low Price - Audio only Mode to switch of video and save power when using Amazon Music - Neat looking TV - No heating even if it's run for whole day continuously - Decent Audio quality Cons: - Very old fashioned remote - Power rating is not 3 stars. This TV takes 65 Watts while similar size of other costlier brands take 50 Watts power. - Not sure if refresh rate could be better.. I see some not so smooth movement of images when watching sports especially. - White looks very bright. So in low backlit setting the White still is prominent. Conclusion: I got this on discount sale for effective price of 9000 /-. Haven't had any problems that would necessitate a call to Service Station.. given that Panasonic Service is supporting this, I must say that it's worth a buy.",Value for Money,B07H7WPV7D
"The TV is fine. I already have a Sanyo TV in the main hall and I wanted to have a smaller one in the bedroom, so I bought this. The problem was with the installation. I wanted a corner mount, and I told that to the lady who called to set up the installation. She told that it costs 2,500/-, I told her was very costly for a TV that costs 10,000/-. I asked her to send specifications of the mount, which she said she would not do. Also, they don‚Äôt keep any in stock and if I wanted one, I would have to book it, without them telling me anything else about it. She was also rude enough to bang the phone when I asked questions about the mount and booked just a normal installation request. She did however tell me that this was a Panasonic brand wall mount before banging the phone. I had to speak with the technician who was kind enough to say that he can come the next day with a corner mount. What I got however is a local mount, which is not able to hold the TV straight, and I have been advised not to move much else the TV would tilt to a side after some time. The mount initially pointed the TV towards the floor. To fix that, the technician made some ad hoc washers and now the TV keeps tilting to the left all the time. The TV is good, but I may not be able to enjoy it much as I guess no one would like watching a tilted TV.",Good Tv. Costly and not so good installation.,B07H7WPV7D
"Good vfm item Sanyo LED TV. Giving it 5 stars for the price i got n same day installation by panasonic,but its 2 early to say abt the long term reliability. Using it for 3 months now no issues.The build quality feels good. The sound is awesome on sd as well as HD pen drive vdo i tried. Back light is bright n clear than major other brands. Compared to sony picture quality is less but compared to lg picture quality even better. Remote control is good n easy to operate menus. Only grime is that its not a smart TV and hdmi, usb ports are difficult to acess once installed as flexi wall mount not provided, fixed wall mount free. Good viewing angles. Thanx Amazon.",Best classy vfm product,B07H7WPV7D
"I had purchased this with an intention to use this TV as an additional monitor for my laptop. and as a TV whenever I wanted. When I tried to connect to laptop via HDMI cable, No signal found message in TV. I can confirm the HDMI cable works fine by connecting the same to another tv or monitor that I have. Also, the color is not matching at all if I connect to tv via VGA cable even after adjusting brightness, contrast etc. If you want to use it as a TV, then full paisa vasool. Go for it without checking further. Strongly recommended. You can play MP3 songs, video files, photos from your pen drive as well.","Worth for the money if you use as a TV, but not as a computer monitor",B07H7WPV7D

"Model number Sanyo 24S7000F. This is high resolution led bulb not a Led TV, amazon refused to return this Led TV. So think twice before ordering this TV. Features and function are good, sound is also good but picture quality is very bad. there is missing of HDR technology, so you cannot adjust white balance, it affects all over screen. My great mistake to choose this full HD led TV from amazon. Pros : 1. It's a full HD led TV under Rs-6300 2. It's manufactured by Panasonic. 3. Excellent sound clarity. 4. Provide music mode, so you can listen music without turning on the display. 5. It's smart remote control comes with media player buttons. Cons:- 1. Narrow viewing angle 60 degree,more than 60 colour faded and negative picture . 2. Not proper balance of white, no HDR, sometimes white colour affects all over screen like over exposed Picture and also white portion more white and dark portion more dark, like cheap Chinese TV. 3. Wrost colour reproduction. Overall I can give 2 üåü out of 5 üåü considering resolution and other features. If you want better picture You can go LG or Panasonic IPS LED TV for better pictures, Don't impress it's full HD feature",Picture Quality very very poor,B07H7WPV7D
"Reasonably satisfied with the performance of this TV though I feel most TVs at this price range would be near about similar in features and performance. So nothing exceptional about the brand or this TV. The sound quality isn't great. Picture quality is good but not sharp. The response time is poor as there's a noticeable gap between command and execution using the remote. The installation was swift within 48 hours. It comes with the wall mount. The remote looks and feels primitive but does its job. In case a different brand is available with better sound even at a slightly higher price, I would recommend that. But overall this TV seems to be a safe bet and value for money",Good without being anything exceptional,B07H7WPV7D

"The screen suddenly developed a black patch which is increasing ever since. There has been no response in changing it or repairing it from the customer service, Sanyo.

I am having Airtel HD set top box connection. Both Airtel HD settop box + Sanyo TV combination is too good. Also sometimes i use to connect my laptop with this TV to use as desktop through hdmi port.

But remember one thing, when you get the product, you have to check all the available ports, you'll never know which port is not working.","Good tv go for it, branded stuff.",B07H7WPV7D

"Till now the TV performs very well in regards of picture as well as sound quality Firstly, discussing about the picture quality. It is good to see at SD channels and very good quality at HD channels. I think preset colour modes are not so much effective except in vivid mode, otherwise you can adjust manually colour settings by your own choice on User mode. Noise reduction should be High mode & dynamic contrust should be in Off mode as it reduces the brightness. Colour temperature should be adjusted to normal or warm mode, because in cool mode it's looking some bluish look on display which is seems to be un-natural colour tone for me. Presently, in my possession one Sony Bravia TV, which is more than twice the price than my Sanyo tv (which is only Rs. 13,490/-). When compairing the both I don't feel so much difference between the two in regarding picture quality. Obviously Sony is better undoubtedly. When you watch white color it seems pure white in Sony. I am using Videocon d2h HD set top box which looks great on the both tv. But when compared in sound quality I observe Sony is far better than Sanyo, I think Sony is the best of all. In Sanyo, some preset sound modes are provided which is average in quality, it may be improved by User mode by adjusting the bass to 90-95 & treble in 60-65. In surround mode, the sound becomes down-graded & lower. I am placing it on table top, so it will be better to Off the surround mode in my opinion. Remote control is simple, looking cheap but effective. After initial adjustment it will not require always if you are using set top box. Regarding connectivity, it has 2 HDMI 2 USB port which works flawlessly when connected to an one TB hard disk but remember, it could not support the all type of audio & video format, 2 composite video-in but there was no component video-in port provided, I think it is not so useful as HDMI port produces a better quality of audio- video & also very compact (only one cable needs as for components 5 cable needed) Conclusion: After an intensive research regarding brand value, real world experience, product reviews, features, weight (4.4Kg), after sell service and above all the price, I found it is the best in class under 15K segment. So go for it if you are planning to buy a low budget Tv with great specifications......",Great Product at an affordable price....,B07H7WPV7D
"Sanyo India is going good with products like these. The tv is good,720p panel will lasts for 30,000 hours(will see, official website claims,use everyday for appx 10 hours and the panel will last for 8 years). Audio is not good,works alright,the sound from speakers is loud but not clear. Usb works fine(mp4 video format works,but official website doesn't lists this format as supported). Hd stb works via hdmi port and is working fine. Writing this review after a month's usage,one star less due to not-so-good audio quality. Hope family TV lasts for claimed 30,000 hours!",Good product at a reasonable price.,B07H7WPV7D
Good as for now.. excellent display considering the price point..but external headphone jack is creating a hissing sound when connected to external speakers.overall satisfied... warranty extended to 1+1 years...,Good value for money..!!,B07H7WPV7D
->Awesome TV in budget. ->Picture clarity and sound is so far very good as I have been using it for almost 1 month no complaints till now. ->I would definitely recommend for people who want to buy TV in budget that to 32 inches then this one is the best according to me.,Simply Awesome,B07H7WPV7D
Bang on for the Buck. Smooth delivery. Good packing .Hassle free Installation. It took like 4 days from order to installation. Performance is good and sits pretty cute on my wall. For it's size and quality I feel there should not be any reason to spend more on a costly product offering the same 32 inch Led product. Sanyo /Panasonic seem to have given a good product in the economy zone bracket. ..keep it up,Bang on for the Buck,B07H7WPV7D

"Got this item. MADE IN INDIA is written on the back. And I decided to give 5 stars. People who ignored this item have missed an opportunity to taste a desert item at the cost of VADA PAV. I am such a smart to purchase this thing at Rs. 12449/-. New addition: Today its 2nd Nov 19. My TV set has gone for repair and it is costing me Rs.4000 + lots of headache. Initially I was thinking I bought a good product. But motherboard caused problem exactly after two years and now I am getting it replaced with new one. And its cost is around Rs.4000. I am not sure weather its a bad luck for me or the quality is actually poor. Remote stopped responding after one year. I had to replace the same. Speakers are not good at all. Poor sound quality. I am sad. Because I bought this only to avoid Chinese products. But a kind of repent. Not because I am thinking I should have gone for the Chinese available but I should have gone for something like Sony or LG or known product to our market. If I face problem again, I will send this product back to amazon or may be Panasonic.",gone for repair and it is costing me Rs.4000,B07H7WPV7D

"ITS SUPER VALUE FOR MONEY! I've specially ordered this by checking the reviews. I seen other expensive ones but was curious if this could beat them as I was on tight budget. Was doubtful at first but after a week.. it has got nothing to disappoint me. The sound was awesome. You don't need to buy separate woofers for this. Amazing bass as well. Picture quality.. build quality.. awesome. If you compare with other expensive ones.. there could be some differences maybe but who cares... you won't even notice it(I tried). Blindly go for it guys. It's brand is also trusted. Sanyo if from Panasonic which is a well known brand highly reputed for their multimedia display manufacturing including phone screen, camera screens etc. PS: Please vote up this review as it helps me come up with more unbiased reviews for whichever products I buy and use.

"I got it for 10K after applying all offers during deal. Its been more than a month now and TV is working absolutely fine. It is as per my requirements and exactly what they have mentioned in the description. Talking about this product, Sound is loud and clear, It has great viewing angles and picture is clear. It was nicely packed and was delivered on time, only problem was in the installation. I did it my self and nobody came for installation. They just kept calling and took appointments but eventually nobody showed up :( One should pay attention to following things before buying a television. However you can get detailed info about the same on amazon.in as well under TV category but theses are important ones: 1) There is a difference between HD Ready, HD/Full HD LED and Smart TV. One should buy according to their needs and budget off course. 2) One should buy TV according to their room size to get effective outcome from a TV. ""Bada hai to ... behtar hai"" won't work in every home. 3) Go for premium brands, so that going further you get proper service/warrant/guarantee.",One of the best TV in this price range,B07H7WPV7D

When contacted via mail to their customer support no reply.Further contacted via Live chat no respnse,they just sayHello, May I help You!.Finally when contacted customer care via voice call.hoping that they could guide me in setting the picture quality they disappointed me telling that they have raised a complaint request and technician will call within 24hrs.

"This was the cheapest 32"" I could find from a brand I had heard about. I don't trust the Chinese brands and Indian brands are typically Chinese ones rebranded. The Korean ones demand a premium. Sanyo is a Japanese brand and I have numerous appliances and gadgets in my home that are Japanese and have lasted decades (yes, decades!). The build quality is good, assembly and mounting are simple. The picture quality is not the sharpest if you are looking from a couple of feet. At 6 ft or more the picture quality is acceptable. The TV is not slim but you get what you pay for. It is certainly lightweight though.","Value for money. I already got a 32"" and when need a 42"" or more I'll again look for a Sanyo.",B07H7WPV7D
"A great buy indeed. Real value fr money. Bought it a month back, the picture and colour quality s great, sound s average, acceptable considering the price. I have paired it up with my Home theatre, it s working fabulously. Thank You Update on 27/10/17:. The panel in my TV is displaying vertical n horizontal lines. Called up Sanyo Service Centre yesterday n hv registered the complaint. Followed up at least 3-4 times, complaint no: R261017832179. Still waiting for a technician to arrive and check. Team Sanyo admin: please help me out. Update on 24/05/18: Just after 14 months, the display of my TV went off. When I consulted Sanyo service Centre they sent a technician promptly. He mentioned the TV's picture panel has developed a snag and it is not repairable, it's life is over. He checked with his office and found out that a new display panel costs INR 16000(pls note the tv buying price was 13500, isn't is extremely odd??? Also if a LED TV panel's life finishes in only one year I really have doubts on the quality of Sanyo TVs.

"I bought this TV in Sep 2017 and it stopped working last month (Dec 2018). I chose this brand over other cheaper options as its a sister brand of Panasonic and the perceived superior Japanese quality. However, the TV stopped working after 15 months and the service centre guys quote an amount of Rs 6,000 to repair as the warranty was only for 1-year. Please do not buy this product unless you get longer warranty. Repairing costs are prohibitive and really makes you wonder if it makes sense to buy a TV at 50% price which lasts only 15 months than paying 100% for a TV that will last at least 5 years. Truly disappointing..",Whats the use of buying cheap product if it does not last,B07H7WPV7D

Sanyo is just a brand recall, the product is manufactured by Panasonic and is made in India. Ideally this product is fit for the first time buyer or people switching over from CRT set to a flat panel (all are welcome), excellent pricing, sturdy build, sound quality is decent, color reproduction is good in terms of depth and screen coverage, the TV menu & remote operation are user friendly. This product include the pedestal, wall mount, remote unit, AAA batteries and few screws. My overall experience 4/5 stars in other words satisfactory.

"This is the best experience I have had in buying an LED TV. Sanyo was independent Japanese company but is now a subsidiary of Panasonic, Japan. So you get a product designed and manufactured by one of the oldest and best electronics companies in the world. Thanks to Amazon who has made purchasing electronics so much easier in India. From online purchasing experience to product delivery and after sales service, Amazon provides complete satisfaction. PROS ---------- 1. Comes with free wall mount kit. Although it looks cheapest possible kit, but it is strong and it works fine. 2. Installation is free and quick. I made call to Sanyo as soon as TV was delivered and the installation guy came in next 2 hours. 3. A+ grade panel. Gives a really pleasing TV experience if you have TV connection with HD quality subscription. 4. 2 HDMI and 2 USB ports. Not many TV in this price range give you so many ports. 5. After buying Sanyo TV, Amazon sends you discount codes for Airtel and DishTV DTH connections. So if you are planning to switch to any of them, you can save money. Minor Issues ------------------- 1. Comes with only 2 cables - power cable and video out cable. There is no RCA cable that is used to connect set-top box to TV. Samsung TV comes with RCA and HDMI cables. But you can use any old cables. 2. USB ports are near the back-center of the TV to the left. After mounting the TV, it is very hard to reach there for a right-handed person. You can either use a better quality wall mount kit or attach a USB extension cable.",Very Good Experience,B07H7WPV7D

I have heard all sort of silly reasons of this faulty TV not working from the technician and strongly believe this is substandard .",Avoid purchasing this faulty TV,B07H7WPV7D

Not a long lasting panel.",Cheap TV for Cheap price,B07H7WPV7D

The TV has a lot of what is known as dirty screen effect. There are these dirty patches and vertical banding on the TV which become prominent when watching something dark. This is very distracting and if it's a problem with all Sanyo tvs then they must do something about it or if it's only a problem with the particular set I received then I am seeking a replacement . Another problem that I found was that the USB player stretches out the image to fit the whole screen even if the movie is in cinemascope and there is nothing you can do by adjusting the aspect ratio. Only you can zoom out but then that's like watching the movie in a 25 inch TV. Again they should provide some firmware update to sort thing out.,Dirty vertical bands and patches under the screen (awful dirty screen effect),B07H7WPV7D

"The picture quality is good as well as the sound especially at this price. Most of the formats works well when trying to play from external device except if the file has some special codecs. After 2 months, one fine day I could see shadows at the left side as well as the upper and the lower sides of the TV screen.Then I lodged a complaint with Sanyo. It seems that the service here in Kolkata is taken care by Panasonic. The technician examined and came to the conclusion that the panel is faulty.He took some snaps and later me asked me to send him some snaps seeing which can be convincing that the fault is really there. Now I am awaiting for further action from Sanyo and i was informed it might take more than 15 days. So that's the scenario with these LED tvs, i guess the old CRT were the best. On 23 Oct, the part was finally replaced with a new panel and we are all happy.Thanks Sanyo!",The picture quality is good as well as the sound especially at this price,B07H7WPV7D
I'm happy about the overall performance of this TV. Fully satisfied with the display and features built in. Although it is 720p but I've no problem in playing even 1080p and that too looked good.

"Got more than expected! Sanyo is not a very well known brand but the quality it produces is awesome. Actually Sanyo had been fully taken over by Panasonic in 2011 and since then these TVs are manufactured by Panasonic in their sub-brand name- Sanyo. In case there is any need for service, it too will be done by the Panasonic technicians. So one can trust this brand. And last but not the least, It's Japan, NOT China.",awesome quality! really satisfied.,B07H7WPV7D
"It seems that company is Japanese only in books otherwise practically it is Chinese product. The sound quality of this TV is worst then anyone imagines .

People can go ahead for this tv if they are planning to buy second tv for bedroom/kitchen/Guest room Then It's Fine. VGA Port for PC is Just Ok.

"ok for the price, picture quality is not that great, refresh rate was showing as 50hz, inspite of the product description saying 60hz. you would see the effect when watching fast movement scenes, you feel like looking away from screen. Not a great TV, but as the top brand TV's are more expensive, and you are ok to compromize on picture quality one can go for it. Better buy it in store, where you can see and compare.

Installation service was very bad. There were just 3 nuts/bolts to be screwed behind the led in wall mount stand but sanyo ( panasonic) service man just fix only two nuts and did not screw third one. I am sure..TV will fall down very soon...as quality of stand is too weak plus service man so lazy that he choose to screw only 2 nuts out of 3. I want to ask sanyo/amazon who will be responsible if my led falls due to weak wallount stand and poor installation?? Overall led seems ok..but Color and sound is not at all matchable to we have in other brands..there is a huge difference....but again at this price ....it is acceptable..if we want to spend less money..then don't expect supreme quality.,Quality of installation service compromised,B07H7WPV7D

I would have given this a 4 star but the sanyo customer care has made me very irritated. The requeat for instalation was raised by me on 11th august but even after 13th august has passed no one from snyo called or talked to us regarding installation, it was only when on 14th august i had to be a tad bit rude with them did they pay any heed to the request. And as this was for my retired aged parents who stay quite far away from me and whoose only source of regular entertainement is the tv i would say sanyo customer care were very unhelpful and negligent in their service.",Bad customer care!!

Now when I went to wall mount the unit I discovered that 3 of the 4 wall mount screw holes namely M1, M2, M3 & M4 on the back panel are jammed. It looks sealed with a broken screw (See the attached picture). This is pathetic and I can't put it on the wall now.

"There are implicit advantages of buying TV offline over online. You are always sure shot that TV will work flawless the first time you turn it on at home, since you checked it before buying at showroom. But this is not the case with online buying. I bought this Sanyo led TV in prime sale from Amazon. When I turned it on, a horizontal green color line appeared at the center of screen. The unit was defective. I called up the Amazon customer care, and was told that to return the TV, it first needs to be inspected by the Sanyo technician. I raised the issue with Sanyo customer care over helpline and was promised that technician will visit in the next 24 hours. But no one visited! So, I called up the customer care again to inquire the status and I was told that the complaint has been closed at their end. This is surprising that the complaint can be closed without resolution. It‚Äôs been 6 days already since the purchase date and amazon return deadline expires in 10 days.

"Excellent product in this price range. I ordered this during Diwali sale period, received a damaged product first time. Replacement took around 10 days, but at the end it was worth it. Installation was perfect and was done within 2 hours of giving a call to Panasonic team. Product is very good in this price range. Have used this LED for a month now, have not faced any issue with TV till now. Played movies through pen drives easily. HD clarity and sound is perfect. I would recommend this product to anyone having a budget..",Excellent product in this price range,B07H7WPV7D

"Hi All, I bought the TV after seeing so many good reviews about the Good Service. In my cards I had Sanyo, VU and Micromax TVs as options to pick. VU TV: Even through many positive reviews, I didn't go for it because my place is little interior and I could not reach the support team at all through phone calls. Micromax TV: Irrespective of many service centers, many negative reviews regarding services. TCL : I never heard of this brand, so I didn't research through. I ultimately decided to purchase Sanyo TV, but had a horrible experience regarding their Service Center & Installation person behavior. I had given them call to install. They sent a young guy in two days. Then we realized the screws were missing from the packing. Installation guy said it is very difficult to get screws in the open market, you have no other way to buy them in open market and he left urgently without installing. Then we realized that he looted away 2 x Rs 500/- notes from my home which we kept on sofa. We bought the screws in next day nearby shop and called for installation again. That guy refused to come and another middle aged man came over and installed it. I complained about this incident to Sanyo customer care, local service center everybody. Case ID # C130217008994. But no action taken at all. So my advice is, if at all you decided to purchase the TV, ""BE VERY CAUTIOUS ON THE PERSON VISITING YOUR HOME FROM PANASONIC/SANYO, the service person may be DANGEROUS even through they speak very nice to you"". Regarding the tv, 1. It will be good for first time buyers, who moving from CRT to LED. 2. Sound quality and pic quality was just average, not so great since only 5MW speakers. 3. White color showing up in little bluish at some channels. 4. Viewing angles from side is not good. We had place it in center of hall, but only who sits opposite could enjoy watching. Not more than 30-45 degree (their advertisement shows 180). 5. You may have few accessories missing from wall mount. That you may need to buy from outside. If at all you don't see better other product outside, then go for Sanyo. Thanks Vasanth",I bought the TV after seeing so many good reviews about the Good Service,B07H7WPV7D

"Bought this TV last month and is using it since then. Sanyo being a good old Japanese brand and being very pocket friendly is the reason I went for this TV. The picture and the audio clarity are really good for this price point. The TV looks good and sleek. The experience of watching HD TV content is really good. The remote is simple and there are many connectivity options, which is a plus. The installation was done by Panasonic technician, who installed the TV on the wall using the wall mount that came with the TV. Only problem I faced is that the audio was not played for some 1080p videos via USB. 720p videos played without any fuss though. Go for this TV if you want a pocket friendly simple TV to watch HD content.",Value For Money Product,B07H7WPV7D

"Good product, don't worry just go for it. Now come the doubts 1. Picture quality and sound quality not good? Ans- Its a budget television, don't expect Samsung Ultra 4k Quantum dot quality. For the price, you can view hd video with no hiccups and the Pictures quality is decent and sound quality is good and its acceptable. The problem is not with Pictures colour production but its with sharpness, edges and depth detail i.e. Motion blur ( that means you are gonna miss the fine details in skin, edges and hairs) but that the case with every television under 15k, so its not like you are specific. And for the sound, speech and high frequencies are clear, no bass but that you can understand for the price. 2. Not able to view video's and play mp3 through pendrive? Ans- Ya its says that the file format is not supported even when its basic mp4, mkv etc. Its because of the Codec problem. So if you get the problem like above, just check your video codec and convert your video using any video converter, that should solve your problem. Also few suggestion, to improve you picture quality use a good branded fiber Audio video cable, it will help to improve picture and sound quality to some extent. And also lower the Contrast and brightness from 50, keep its between 30-40 and sharpness to 55-65 with medium temperature",A Good product. Read my reviews for doubts clearance,B07H7WPV7D

"This is a ""value for money"" item on Amazon. I paid Rs. 12990 during a Sale period and when opting for a 'lightning deal'. Considering that Sanyo is now a subsidiary of Panasonic, the pricing for this TV is possibly the lowest for a well known brand name. I set it up myself and found it quite user friendly. HD quality was quite impressive when connected to a TataSky HD set top box. However when I played a .mkv file on a pen drive inserted into one of the USB ports, the quality was about average. I played the same .mkv file through a small media player connected to the TV (via an HDMI cable of course) at the second HDMI port and there was a remarkable improvement in video quality. I am not attributing this average performance through the USB port as a defect as I have observed it happens with other popular TVs too. This is where the Sanyo's second HDMI port comes handy. Not many 32"" TVs have two HDMI ports (in this price range). I opted for placing the TV on a console (not on the wall) and fitting the supporting feet was very simple. Being a LED TV, it was very light in weight. All in all a worthwhile purchase if on a budget and have space / distance constrains.","This is a ""value for money"" item on Amazon. ...",B07H7WPV7D

"Great TV with lots of features at a great price too. So why only 3 stars? The user manual is poorly written. There is no clue on how to assemble it for table top use. One picture shows the TV and the two clamps at the bottom and says ""attach them and you are done""! Not exaggerating, but there is just that one sentence by way of instruction. The user already has the TV and the clamps, knows that they need to be attached, so what guidance is the manual offering?? We figured out how to attach the clamps only to find that holes were untapped and some other holes that did not require any screws were threaded instead! Screws provided look like they are self tapping types but no mention of what tools are needed. We somehow managed to force the screws and make it stand upright, it is still not stable enough. Product rates 5 stars but for the total disaster in assembly.",Great TV but ...,B07H7WPV7D

"Hello friends, this is the best Value-for-Money TV. If you are on a tight budget but want a good quality TV with lots of features, then you should consider this. Please note that Sanyo brand is owned by Panasonic Corporation, so the installation and future service, if needed, will be taken care by Panasonic Corporation. Sanyo and Panasonic are Japanese companies and not Chinese, so you can expect some good standard quality. Coming to this TV, there are 3 variants available on Amazon. 32 inch variant is HD ready (720p) but you can some 1080p content also on it. 43 and 49 inch variants are Full HD. The major difference between the three variants, apart from size, is the speakers. The 32 inch TV has two 5W speakers, whereas the 43 and 49 inch TVs have two 8W speakers, so sound quality on 32 inch TV will be average, not so loud. Sound quality on 43 and 49 inch variants will be better. But still don't expect the sound quality of Sony TVs, they are of superior quality and hence pricey. I would suggest that you also buy a good hi-fi speaker system (preferably with a sub-woofer) with this TV to enhance the sound quality of your TV. There are many good speakers systems available on Amazon, from 2000 to 7000. You can choose depending on your budget. About the ports available on this Sanyo TV, all the 3 variants have - 2 HDMI ports, 2 USB ports, PC IN (VGA and Audio) ports, AV and RF ports. You can connect your PC/Laptops via the VGA or HDMI ports and use it like a large PC Monitor. You can also connect Amazon Fire TV stick or Google Chromecast to stream movies via Amazon Prime, Netflix, etc and you can also browser youtube on this. With all these features your TV becomes a Smart TV. The picture quality is on par with LG/Samsung, on all the 3 variants (32, 43 and 49 inch). Installation will be done by Panasonic service team within 24-48 hours of delivery. If you don't want to wall mount the TV, they will still help you set-up the TV for the first time and give you helpful information on protecting your TV. Amazon delivery and Panasonic service are great. While Amazon takes utmost care to deliver the TV in a safe and perfect condition, in case you receive a damaged/defective TV, don't panic, just take some pictures of damage/defects, send them to Amazon via email to: cs-reply@amazon.in and then call Amazon customer service, they will arrange for a return pick-up of the damaged/defecive TV and also send you a free replacement within 2-4 business days. Overall, this Sanyo TV is a good option for those who want a full featured branded TV within a budget. No other brand offers such TVs in this price range. I hope this review helps you make a purchase decision.","Great value for money TV from Sanyo with lots of Ports. Sound quality is average, better buy separate speaker system.",B07H7WPV7D

"I have purchased this SANYO TV (32 inch) and i sent it to my sister's native place on last year October, this year July month (within 9 months) suddenly stopped to run. my sister uneducated person, once TV stopped to run she called local TV technician that guy opened the panel and said motherboard dead, after that it comes to know me, i called SANYO customer care, Sanyo technician came to my sister's home (near to Vandavasi-Tindivanam) and replaced the motherboard, unfortunately that time power cut in that particular area, so unable to check TV after replace the motherboard, once power back to home we connected the TV but still not run. Hence, again i called the SANYO (vellore) customer care they said we cant come again to your home for service, you need to bring the TV to our service center like that they saying. now problem is that service center 100 kilo meter away from my sister's house. how can carry TV that much distance.

"A good TV for its price. Good sound and clarity. A lot of setting options are available for adjusting picture and sound. Slight issues like the panel frame is tight at the edges but slightly loose in the center. Rest all good till now. Got wall mount along in a separate package along with the TV. Perfect on time delivery by FedEx. The service is prompt and TV got installed within 48 hours of registering a request (including Sunday). Panasonic is the owner of Sanyo brand so service provided by it only. You can purchase the item without second thought if you are wishing to buy a good budget LED TV. Durability will be tested over time, can't say now :) Please don't believe negative reviews, they are all fake or the people do not know how to change settings.",A good TV for its price,B07H7WPV7D

You just had to call the Sanyo customer care and they will send send a Panasonic person within a day to install this. (Sanyo is a Panasonic subsidiary). Guess you won't get a branded product at this price point. During the Diwali sales there was additional discount and effective cost was 13K. In fact if you were using some cards you would even get additional discount. Excellent entry level HDTV.",Good value for money during Diwali Sales,B07H7WPV7D

"Absolute VFM product. I bought this from Amazon, and I have been using it for past 9 months. Picture quality is just awesome. Sound quality is good too. I have anyway connected it to a 2.1 F&D speaker set and it's working like charm. Total amount spent on this product is 11k and it's a perfect buy. I installed it myself and haven't had raised any service requests yet. So not sure how responsive the customer service center is. Would strongly recommend this. PS: This product came with an additional cash back offer on payments made using hdfc cards. I had to do a lot of follow up and escalations for almost 7-8 months to get the cash back. Amazon customer care response was very bad IMO. That's the only issue I had with this purchase.",Absolute VFM product,B07H7WPV7D

"Sanyo HD Ready 32"" LED TV is splendid, competing with other top brands. The moment I received the product, I felt the TV looks like a Chinese product as the menu looked pretty outdated. The Sanyo TV's in US are different from the one's manufactured India. Looking at few videos in Youtube, got hope that it is an original Sanyo product (menu and remote control unit looked similar) as the web site for US and India are completely different. The model numbers are also different in both the countries. When questioned about the 10 years panel lifetime claim, support personnel said the TV would last for 10 years if used for 8 hours a day. Approximately, the count is 29,000 hours that Sanyo claims their TV would last. I have a Sanyo 15 years old CD player cum Casette recorder set with speakers which is still working excellent. That is the only reason I bought Sanyo TV. Got it for 12,990 in Oct 1 lightning deal. Absolutely worth every penny. Pros: Picture clarity is brighter and sharp when viewing HD movies. Sound is better than other LED TV's when as there are 2 box speakers embedded inside. Has AV1 and AV2 inputs, a VGA, a headphone out, 2 HDMI, 2 USB - 1 HDMI input has a separate audio out pin. Sanyo gives 1+1 year extended warranty if purchased before 31st Oct 2016. [...] Cons: Menu is absolutely outdated. Sanyo needs to concentrate on cosmetic changes in future products to compete with Sony, LG and Samsung. Screen looks bluish sometimes like hp laptops and lenovo full hd phone's display. The screws provided completely doesn't knock-in. One gets inside and the other one stays bit outside in both left and right sides.",Worth buying!!,B07H7WPV7D
