"Sony did not disappoint with this one. Its Sharp, bright, with adequate audio and smart with features which work. What does not work is the remote with Tata sky. Some of the channels to control audio needs Sony remote and some the Tata remote. This also does not have have auto brightness control which is not good as my 12 year old LCD had that. Something I will live with. TV is excellent.","Excellent, maybe just short",B07QB77C92
"Awesome product actual price is 59k which is the MRP and got it for 46k with 5%cash back from Sony. About TV u will get default app as YouTube, Netflix, sonyLiv, PrimeVideo. You can't install any other app. It contains Web browser where you can browse the necessary contains. Sound is awesome even at full sound clarity is awesome. It contains HDMI ARC support where you can connect external sound system, also it contains a 1 headphone out. If any doubt post a question I will help you overall with 43k with 5% cashback it's an awesome purchase.","Awesome, that's all I can say",B07QB77C92

"Bought my sony bravia tv in the great indian festival with some discounts and a two year special screen warranty benefit. My review is for the common people who wants to enjoy 1080i HD quality with DD+ sounds at home without paying money to the theatres ‚ò∫Ô∏è I always wanted to watch movies in 1080i hd because now a days the TV channels r HD and I downloaded a lot of movies from torrents in 1080i but couldn't see this pic quality as I had only 720i HD ready monitor üòí Don't be fooled by the word HD READY cus those r only 720i and not gives u 1080i! This TV has TRUE 1080i resolution with true DD+ sound effects with 30w output. This is the most affordable bravia in 30k range. Other brands do manufacture smart TVs at low price but u can't have this quality sounds and picture in those TVs.About the delivery,it was really nice and the TV installer came and mounted my TV in wall with zero cost. But one thing , AMAZON BUYERS, IF U BUY ANY SONY PRODUCT FROM AMAZON ALWAYS LOOK FOR ONLY TWO SELLER : CLOUDTAIL & APPARIO . Because only these r Sony authorized dealer. Sony provides full support for these two sellers . I have found this thing only on their website. My seller was CLOUDTAIL. It's total value for money and hope not to buy a TV for at least a decade üòÄ",The Best FULL HD LED TV for middle class common people like us !,B07QB77C92

Picture quality is great. But a man came from sony for installation updates tv's software which makes picture quality bad. After making system restore now its giving good picture again. I recommend not to update tv's pre-installed software. No official software update available from sony online for this television.,Sony bravia 32 inch 1080p hdr tv,B07QB77C92
"I was looking for 32 inch smart tv for 1 month & after good research I finally came across this one. Although the price is a bit higher from other brands, the quality of tv is exceptionally good. I shortlisted some options & experienced them at stores & trust me I was blown away by Sony‚Äôs quality. The picture & sound output was just unmatchable if you compare them with other brands eye to eye. I decided to buy it from Amazon as it came for 32K. delivery was super quick. Kudos to Amazon! I‚Äôve been using this TV daily & I‚Äôm very happy that I bought it. The picture quality is undoubtedly the best in this price range. Not just picture, sound is something which you‚Äôll be amazed to hear! I thought I would need extra speakers but I was wrong. You don‚Äôt need any additional speakers with this TV. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a durable product without any compromise on quality in any way.",Simply the best!,B07QB77C92

"I purchased 32 in Sony Bravia in 2014 and within 2 years it stopped working and every parts started getting failed. First its screen got off. second time its panel got off. Every time I paid more than 10000 to service center to repair and every time I faced a new challenge. Now, again one more problem raised inside the TV. I would suggest don't go for Sony, they only cost higher but Product is always of less quality. I am really got frustrated with Sony product.",Worst product and service from Sony,B07QB77C92
"After a lot of analysis and comparisons, finally went with this Sony Full HD Earlier I used Philips 29"" FHD Reason, best picture quality. I could feel this Sony HD picture quality is far better than LG, Samsung 4K UHD TV's. Sound quality is really good and very clear. Panasonic and Sony are providing relatively best picture and sound quality. Smart TV options are good and adequate.",Loving it...,B07QB77C92
Now in Sony website it is only MRP Rs 33990 I am purchase in sathiya appliances Rs 31000 in no cost EMI bajaj fenserv Good sound and quality,About this new Sony tv,B07QB77C92
This is my second Sony BRAVIA tv. My old Sony BRAVIA which is 10 year old is still working without any issues. Picture and sound quality of this TV is excellent. Initially I thought i might need sound bar as the inbuilt tv speakers are down firing speakers. But trust me the dynamic drive speakers are awesome. You will get well balanced sound with decent bass and voice is very clear.(Thanks to ClearAudio+ digital sound processing technology). Picture quality is top. Sony‚Äôs picture quality is awesome compared to Samsung and LG. The price of Sony BRAVIA is more but you get good picture and sound quality. All the apps are running smoothly without any issues. After software update ZEE5 app is added. Though the TV runs on linux but the UI is smooth like android tv. The TV supports almost all the video formats when playing video files from the USB device. I recommend this Smart TV to everyone. Thanks SONY! ‚ù§Ô∏è,Excellent!,B07QB77C92
hotstar is not working on it,cant install apps,B07QB77C92
Excellent picture quality and clear sound with deep bass. However the smart functionality could be better in terms of installing other apps. Cannot cast photos and videos from iPhones. Bluetooth functionality for headphones would have been helpful as well. Come on Sony stop being so stingy when u‚Äôll are charging a bomb for your products üòä,Excellent TV. Can be better.,B07QB77C92
"I bought this product for 40k from an offline retailer. I must say I am more than impressed with this product. The colors are very vibrant and the contrast too. Speaking of sound quality, the tv is placed at a distance of 8 feet from my sofa, because the room it's kept in is quite spacious. It's 20W speakers does a brilliant job even in a room of that stature. Crisp, loud, deep bass gives you a home theater feeling. The product might be on the costlier side than other brands as sony never tries to capture the niche market, but you can blindly trust on this product.",Awesomeness at its best,B07QB77C92
"Bought from Shop on onam offer with Head Phones free and 2 year extended Panel warranty at Rs.40,000/- IPS panel with Clear picture and clear sound, Only full HD no 4k, The SD channels clarity is vert good.
