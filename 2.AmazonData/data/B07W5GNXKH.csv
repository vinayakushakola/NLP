"*Best TV in 40 inch category* I was looking for a 40 to 43 inch branded Smart TV and decided to settle for 40N5200. First of all, it's 40 inch size, which is not much of difference from 43 inch. Secondly, I was getting a branded TV of that size for under 30K. I got this on an EMI of Rs 1500 only. I had explored online as well as in few retail stores - no significant brand sells 40 inch Smart TV at this price! The Picture Quality is superb with amazing colors, brightness and details. The sound quality is very good with amazing vocal clarity This TV is extremely easy to control and clutter free. Another thing that stands out is the pre-built VoD apps such as Netflix, Prime, Voot, Hotstar, Zee5 etc. This is a Smart 7-in-1 TV that can be used as a laptop as it has built-in Microsoft Office 365 which I don't think any other TV offers. Plus, the TV comes with a Tune Station App with a visually stunning equalizer which is a big plus for me as I am a music lover. Screen mirroring works smoothly without any lag. It has Bluetooth capability so I can pair my phone with TV and listen to music as well. It also has a special feature called LiveCast which helps you broadcast live on the TV from anywhere in the world Overall, this is a wonderful buy if you are looking for a 40 or 43 inch branded Smart TV.",Best TV in 40 inch category,B07W5GNXKH
"The television is decent enough considering it's price. Sound quality is neither great not bad. It is good enough for a television but for music and all you have to get additional speakers. Remote is very compact so you will need time to get used to it. Amazon delivery was awesome. Why not 5 stars? 1. The customer support team of Samsung says our service center is closed on Sunday without even trying to get the facts. When I called the service center from just dial, they were open and did the installation on Sunday. 2. The app store is not rich and sort of forces you to use apps of Samsung's choice. 3. You can not use Amazon music, wynk because they have gana app preinstalled and you can not uninstall it. 4. They have useless apps like cric mania and sunnxt which takes a lot of memory of 1 GB RAM that it offers. The sunnxt offers some bengali, Tamil and Telugu channels no Hindi, no English. Why on Earth will I want to have it in my TV ?? 5. Come on it's a 1 GB television the least you can do is remove these bloatwares.",Samsung forces user to use apps of it's choice.,B07W5GNXKH
"This TV is a Must Go option considering the Price and the Specification. If you guys have the Volume problem, go to settings and change the sound option to Optimized mode so that the sound will be good. Over all best TV at this price range. Just go for it.üòçüòç",Best TV at this Price range,B07W5GNXKH
Everthing is good but its not well how do i say this much hd as much i expect,Ohk,B07W5GNXKH
Samsung has always delivered quality product. Market Value of China product is cheaper but still i had chosen samsung tv. Amazing picture quality as well sound too. network connection is good as well as mobile connectivity is also amazing. Service of amazon is great as per written as particular time. Installation of tv is done at the same day of delivery.,Highly Recommended,B07W5GNXKH
"It's not worth I think I was using Philips 39 inches he led , Philips was better than this wrong purchase. Installation is big fraud like I thought wall mount is included. But it's not included once I got TV I am flooded with calls for installation. After so many call's I ask one to come and he knows there's no wall mount. I asked will you provide he said if its rotating one 1600 (in online it's cost is 350 which it can hold up to 50 inches TV) . See how big fraud it is ,they are just utilising situations. Asked bill he said no sir we will not provide bills. Amazon you should look into this.",Installation fraud,B07W5GNXKH
"Even after 4-5 days, of product delivery, still I am waiting for the demo / installation from the samnsung service provider. Getting full of calls from different numbers in connection with installation. But no one comming. I am thinking to initiate a return request",Samsung Smart LED remain unpacked 4 days after the delivery,B07W5GNXKH
"This tv delivers good value for money. the smart tv features work really well, the ui is simple and no lag what so ever. I use prime and youtube extensively, no complaints. the viewing angles are slightly bad, if you are watching from the side the picture looks slightly whitish. If you are in front, it looks great. the speakers are also good, it has a decent bass",cheapest smart tv from samsung,B07W5GNXKH
"Very very nice tv Picture, sound, connectivity is very good",Full paisa vasul,B07W5GNXKH
"Overall the tv is a good option to consider except one thing. The volume. I use it on tata sky via hdmi, but the tv volume is very low",Average option to consider,B07W5GNXKH
Ignore all negative reviews....This smart TV comes with great picture and sound quality in just 28K as well as 18 months no cost EMI! You can't get better than that from any other brand...Thanks Samsung and Amazon.,Great picture and sound quality,B07W5GNXKH
Best buy. Go ahead and get it.,Absolutely gorgeous.,B07W5GNXKH
After 10 days TV stopped working and Amazon not providing refund. Amazon said Samsung will provide replacement but samsung said Amazon has to provide replacement. Both are playing with me. I lodged complaint in Consumer forum.,Very worst,B07W5GNXKH
"delivery and installation was done same day at varanasi , i called samsung immediatly after delivery got installation same day , sound is not good as compared to my another TV that is SONY , picture quality good , apps are limited to tizen OS",delivery and installation was done same day at varanasi,B07W5GNXKH
"I like the Picture Quality. It doesn't disappoint. Blade Runner 2049 looked amazing. Sound Quality is adequate for my room. No complaints. But, my problem is with the samsung pre-installed apps. They are very slow to load and im not a huge fan of the interface. IMO, one should go for a non-smart Samsung TV & get Amazon Fire Stick. Fire Stick is uber fast with an amazing voice remote. That would have been a better option. Overall, its a 3.5/5 star Value for Money product. Its good. Thats it.",It's GOOD.,B07W5GNXKH
"I'm writing this review after nine days of buying the TV.. And in these nine days, I wrote down what I understood about this tv.. PICTURE QUALITY - Just one word.. ""Fantastic"" .. You can watch clearly from any angle of your room. SOUND QUALITY - Many people are saying the tv sound is low .. but it's not true.. the sound of this tv are awesome.. If you are not satisfied with the TV sound, Then go to Settings and click on Optimize .. then you'll hear the difference.. CONNECTIVITY - Here's the big thumbs down.. I'm not satisfied with this.. The TV can only be connected to a Samsung phone for mirroring screen, Use Pre- installed Gallery app , Samsung account etc.. even I can't connect the phone, with USB cable.. very disappointed.. You must have a Samsung phone for use these features.. You can connect bluetooth from your phone easily, and also Hotspot for Watch YouTube etc.. 100000+ HOURS WATCH TIME - I think it's totally wrong.. because.. when I went to open a NETFLIX account, Then it's asking me for subscription money.. It's not just on Netflix, even it's happening in Prime video app.. I don't know why.. Overall the tv is awesome.. at this price point this tv is value for money.. you can go for it..",Read this before buy this TV,B07W5GNXKH
Good quality. Worth its price. Best in price range.,Worth the money,B07W5GNXKH
Good sound quality acoustically speaking with surround effect. HDMI connected volume is lower as there are two remotes for volume adjustment. Eg dth remote and tv remote.Picture quality improves with adjustments of back light and contrast but can be better. Connects to the internet. One can play YouTube videos directly. Plays amazon prime videos. Connects to usb mouse which can be operated while on internet. Connects to iPhone to play Apple TV videos. Apple TV app also plays directly. To check other functionalities like keyboard connection and office. Overall good product.,Smart value for money,B07W5GNXKH
"Affordable Smart TV Netflix and Amazon prime dedicated buttons on remote Good sound quality You can download other video streaming apps YouTube/Netflix/Amazon Prime pre installed Customer service is excellent,",Excellent TV in this price,B07W5GNXKH
"I am a little disappointed by this product. I have a Samsung series 6 from Jan 2015, and the picture quality for that is significantly better than this. The viewing angle is the major problem. When viewed at an angle greater that sixty degree or so, the Colors aren‚Äôt that great. That‚Äôs the biggest disappointment. Otherwise, decent value for money","Value for money, but disappointed by picture quality",B07W5GNXKH
"I got this product on 6th Oct 2019. Today is 20 th October , no one has came to my home for TV installation from Samsung. I have contacted samsung customer care daily. They promise to visit for installation but no one cares . They always give false promise to customer and do Not delivers it. I will never recommend anyone to buy any Samsung products due to their worst customer service. Thanks",Samsung Hater,B07W5GNXKH
"This is a great TV for those who need premium quality on a budget. The display and sound quality is perfect for the price that we pay. The design of the TV could have been made better in my opinion. The picture quality is crisp and clear and the 40 watts speakers(the user manual says so) provide clear and ample sound with mild bass. Once connected to a wired or wireless high speed internet connection, the TV brings out its full potential and offers a plethora of content. Additional apps can be downloaded from the App Store which includes Apple TV, Facebook etc. Screen mirroring is a really useful feature on this TV. I couldn‚Äôt find out any major flaws after using this TV as for the price that I paid, I am completely satisfied with what this TV is providing. I don‚Äôt think that one needs a service technician to install the TV if it need not be wall mounted as all the instructions are clearly mentioned in the user manual. I did the installation and setup on my own and it was as easy as one, two, three!! We were using a 32 inch Samsung FHD LED TV for the past 9 years and is still working impeccably. But, we decided to upgrade to this as we wanted to have a smart TV since a long time & got this on a really attractive offer from Amazon. I really hope that this TV would serve us well like it‚Äôs predecessor!!! I would completely recommend this TV to anyone on a budget looking for a VFM TV.",Perfect For Our Family!!,B07W5GNXKH
Awesome experience,Overall good,B07W5GNXKH
The Product is excellent and value for money. The Smart features are extraordinary and user friendly. Sound quality is decent and feels like working with a normal Sound bar. Picture quality is good and require few settings to be done to get in depth clarity. Once done you will get extraordinary picture quality. Overall the product is good. After Delivery I received a call from Samsung and Samsung Associate reached my home to deliver the Wall Mounted Frame and fixed at free of cost which included in the price . Overall Satisfaction is excellent with respect to both Buying experience and as well as Samsung quality.,Excellent Product and Value for Money,B07W5GNXKH
"I purchased 17 Oct 2019 in diwali sale TV is good , installation done by the same day ( the technician came from Samsung) but it take generally 48hrs after delivery of product.but I did not receive remote control AAAZ batteries. TV , technology, every thing good, bluetooth technology is very excellent but we can watch full HD Channels only By using SD connection it is not effective. Sound 20W only also good ,if it 40W then very excellent",Best TV,B07W5GNXKH
Recently bought this TV on great Indian sale. Product delivered within 2 days and very next day got call from local Samsung customer service and by evening they installed it but they have not given any demo. Display and sound quality of the TV is good. Only few apps are installed in it. So if you need more apps more features I recommend you to buy Amazon fire TV stick. SD channel quality is also good if watched from 10 ft distance. HD channels are delight to watch. Also got confirmation message from acko team regarding additional 1 year extended warranty. Screen mirroring via honor phone is quick and easy.,Nice tv at affordable price,B07W5GNXKH
"TV has a good picture quality, bright and crisp. Dedicated button for prime video and Netflix on remote is very useful. My previous TV was 42"" and this TV being of 40"" appears very small, although the difference is merely 2"". Wall installation mechanism is very good. Sound quality is OK but on feeble side. You have to keep sound mode 'optimised' but still volume of around 50 would be OK in a 2BHK and around 70-75 in 3BHK sized flat. It would have been good had Samasung provided 'surround' mode or sound 'equalizers'. The deal was a real catch for me 1000 off during festival season and 2000 off for SBI card offer, total 27000-3000 = 24000/-. Owners of Samsung mobile phones have got added advantage for app-based remote facility, and cast screen and samsung gallery.",Rewarding deal and brand of Samsung,B07W5GNXKH
Received a defective product. And the seller Cloudtail India is not ready to accept the Replacement. Go for this TV only if you want to waste your time and money for no reason. But Samsung customer service was very good. UPDATE: Seller agreed for replacement. will update once item received,Pathetic Service by Amazon,B07W5GNXKH
"The model in the description is 2019, however but actually it is 2018. It has compatibility issues with Alexa Smart TV does not have Bluetooth feature nor have voice command feature. Old wine new bottle, pls buy LG or Sony for better features. Even MI TV is more advanced",Not an comparable TV in this generation,B07W5GNXKH
It‚Äôs a very good product one should go for this one if looking for a smart tv..Amazon delivery was super fast and installation was done with in 2 hours of delivery..Thnk u Amazon,Worth buying it,B07W5GNXKH
In this price segment you can also get MI tv(4k 43 inch TV) but consider these aspects. Samsung FHD is far better than MI 4K TV in terms of picture quality . SOUND is great. No Connectivity issues unlike MI TV which irritates you while connecting.. And the biggest. Fact SAMSUNG. Great after sale service Brand value.. etc,Go for it,B07W5GNXKH
"I went for Samsung for it's brand but it's losing its value due to its customer service. It's been a week and no one came for installation , after repeated calls to service center they assigned a person yet no progress. Replacement time is 10 days and still tv was not installed. I have 3 days time now and need to check tv functioning is good or not ( if installation is done). Not expected this from Samsung care Update: Installation was done and all features in tv was good. Clarity and sound is also good.",Took long time for installation and TV is good,B07W5GNXKH
"I bought this tv last week. I can say this tv is value for money for some one who is looking for a decent 40 inches FHD smart tv less than 25k. Excellent picture quality and sound quality is definitely above average. I saw negative reviews of sound quality. That is totally ridiculous. This model has all great features that one can expect in a smart tv. Most of the apps like prime, zee, Netflix are compatible. I am assuming hotstar can be downloaded. Pros Pricing! Samsung has kept aggressive pricing for this model. HD Picture quality. Definitely better than mi 43 smart model. Smart features. Samsung brand value, service and 2 years warranty (panel only). Cons Sd channels picture quality from dth is not great. One should go for hd channels. I am using Tata sky. I recommend to upgrade to hd subscription if a person uses dth more than smart features. Only two hdmi port. Three would have been better for people who have gaming consoles and speaker systems. However serious gamers like PS4 users. Go for 4k Models.",One of the best 40 inches FHD smart tv less than 25k,B07W5GNXKH
"Best TV in 40 inch in this price range, no other brand will provide you better than this in this price segment. Picture and Sound Quality is great, Mobile Mirror is very easy to use and can be easily connected. Netflix and Amazon prime runs very smoothly something it gets sticky due to less network speed but overall it is great. If we are talking about its installation..it usually done within 48 hours of delivery..in my case they came to next day after delivery and did the Free installation with wall mount..nd No Charge taken for the wall mount stand ,they did it Free of cost...Amazon delivery nd Samsung Service was Awesome. Overall I will recommend this TV in this price range.",Best TV in 40 Inch,B07W5GNXKH
Good deal in all aspects. just the wall mounting is not in the box. you have to call Samsung and engineer will git it and mount at home free of cost but i want wall mounting with tv delivery,recommended,B07W5GNXKH
"1. I was looking for a 40 to 43 inch branded Smart TV and decided to settle for 40N5200. First of all, it's 40 inch size, which is not much of difference from 43 inch. Secondly, I am getting a branded TV of that size for 26K. 2. The Picture Quality is superb with amazing colors, brightness and details. The sound quality is very good with amazing vocal clarity but it contains only one USB Port and not supporting for multi USB Ports which i had brought externally,so at a time we can't use mouse, pendrive.aprt from this it's a very very nice product.if you want to buy a branded television just go for it. compare to MI Samsung is a worth for me.. 3. This TV is extremely easy to control and clutter free. Another thing that stands out is the pre-built VoD apps such as Netflix, Prime, Voot, Hotstar, Zee5 etc. 4. This is a Smart 7-in-1 TV that can be used as a laptop as it has built-in Microsoft Office 365 which I don't think any other TV offers.

"I am not big in to watching TV. I am more of a computer guy for entertainment. I didn't want to buy cheap TV products from China, but also was not looking for expensive Rs.40k+ TVs from Samsung, LG or Sony. Got this samsung TV at an amazing price of 25k. I was not going to buy a traditional TV cable (settop box). Needed a smart TV with netflix, amazon, youtube & HDMI playback. This one just works out of the box for me. PROS: - Good enough picture quality - Most apps work flawlessly: Netflix, Amazon Prime, Youtube, etc. Good optimisation by Samsung - Dedicated netflix & prime button is really helpful - Enough sound for my need. - Good wifi connectivity. I use this TV on home wifi completely. (Don't have or plan to buy Cable.) - Can directly cast my OnePlus 6 to this TV which even uses the sound from the TV itself. Overall an easy to use TV which just works out of the box. CONS: - On receiving realised the energy efficiency of this TV is BEE 2-star. This is not mentioned anywhere. - This seems to be a low cost LED panel to compete with the Chinese counterparts. Hence the lower price. But surely, the quality output, the samsung OS & apps totally make it a good buy at 25k for me.",Good TV I got at amazing price.,B07W5GNXKH

"Hi, Overall it's a good product. In Samsung after 5 series they have improved their connectivity things in terms of tech. So if you are basically looking for a TV with a good picture quality and connectivity as bluetooth, cloud, USB etc... it's one of the good option, and within this range of price it's best one. You will get decent sound, can't expect from a 20W speaker though. In terms of picture quality, well compared to 7 series models, have to admit it's back in race, but if you are using a good quality dish it's acceptable. through USB it's playing 1080p very clearly and doesn't support 4K however. as conclusion to consider this or not, you must choose it.. it's a go for it with in that price range.",Worth for what you spent.,B07W5GNXKH
TV is awesome... sound quality is best... picture quality is perfect!! Installation done as per my convenience though some parts are missing for mount installation!!

"We are very happy with the TV. The display quality is absolutely fantastic, as expected. The ease of installing apps makes it convenient. There are dedicated Netflix and Prime buttons which makes it fast. If the TV is connected to the Home Theatre system, the TV itself controls its ON/STAND-BY modes and volume controls, so you don't need to use any other remote control. You can even chuck the casting devices because you won't need them. Smart indeed. The on-board casting is super fast and the quality snaps in from the beginning- no need to watch pixelated nonsense for the first few seconds. Our only pain point is typing to search for something since there is no voice command.",A fantastic purchase,B07W5GNXKH
"Thank you Amazon India :) you made the festive season more memorable one. Also, installation by Samsung representative within 24 hrs of delivery, that also on Sunday is much appreciated!

"This product is best if you want to buy under budget. Also it has no cost EMI for 18 months. Pros: picture quality, value for money, sound quality, connectivity with mobile if you have samsung mobile. Cons: screen mirroring issues with non samsung mobiles. So if you want to buy a smart tv specially a samsung brand and if you are buying smart tv because you dam wanna mirroring your content from your mobile to TV. Other cons: you cannot install other apps. I tried hotstar but it does not install. Processing and refresh rate is slow.

"I have been using Samsung Led Tvs since 2013 and they've been brilliant, on both the picture quality as well as reliability fronts. I used to be a huge fan of the Sony Bravia range until I shifted to Samsung which has since become the global leader in Led tvs. I was on the lookout for a 40 inch Smart FHD Led Tv for my bedroom and along came the Amazon Diwali offer! I bought it without a second thought and have been enjoying my purchase ever since. The Led panel is extremely bright and colourful and being a firm believer in calibrating my Tvs instead of using the default settings, I have turned down the backlight and contrast levels to 60 percent and set the contrast enhancer to high instead. The picture quality is excellent with Full High Definition material. The only gripe that I have is that the contrast levels of objects in the distant background appears a little washed out as opposed to the foreground contrast in this particular model. My view could be subjective and perhaps might be because 3 of the 4 other Samsung Tvs which I have are 6 series models which are supposed to have 20-25% better contrast than the 5 series models. I have the Tv hooked up to a mid-range Denon 7.2 channel Av receiver and KEF speakers and subwoofer, so I don't really have a need for outputting sound from the Tv speakers. However, the audio quality is good as well (for an Led tv) and there is a sufficient amount of bass. Vocals are clear and the treble is crisp without being fatiguing. At INR 34,000, discounted to INR 25,000 for Diwali, the Tv was a steal, considering it's obvious quality and brand value.",An Excellent Tv at a brilliant price,B07W5GNXKH

Sumsumg smart TV is best.,Buy a new TV only sumsumg.,B07W5GNXKH
Almost two months over using this product. Picture quality and sound are nice. No lag when we try to move among pre-installed apps. Remote is standard one not the voice controlled. Only complaint from me is only one USB port available on this TV.,Value for money.,B07W5GNXKH
