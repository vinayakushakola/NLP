Received a defective product which has green dots on the screen when turned on. I have been behind Amazon since the day I received this TV to have it replaced but they keep pushing back. Literally awful support from Amazon. They are just waiting for the replacement period to get over. I‚Äôm having a horrid time speaking to the cust executives and no responses on mail as well. Most of the functions in the TV are good but I don‚Äôt think it is as great as hyped about. My advice would be to go for Blaupunkt through flipkart.,Defective Product and Pathetic support,B07X841RGL
"Most probably, the MI TV 4X 50 inch is having VA Panel. There is no way to find out whether it is IPS/VA, at least from the Menu. The display is very good, except for the light bleeding in complete dark area or scene. This will not affect your viewing experience. User interface especially menu is a bit tricky. One useful feature is it remembers the last input source. So if you are watching TATASKY-->Switch off --> Switch On --> The source last played will be selected by default. HDMI ARC is working fine, but getting the ARC through the Yamaha Receiver (HTR3067) was a herculean task. Android TV is good. Prime Video starts and plays without any hiccup from the Remote. I have got it on the first day sale for Rs.27000/- (SBI Offer + Amazon Cashback). The TV is total value for the money. Esp 4K HDR 50 inch display at this price with reasonably good build quality is excellent. Reduced one star because of the basic remote (No mute button) and No standby mode. If you switch off from Remote, the TV shuts down (No standby) and restarts from the scratch if you switch on again. I heard that the you can take it to standby mode through voice command, yet to test that part. Update 17.10.2019: There is a provision to keep TV on standby. Press and hold the power button. Select ""switch off video"".",Value for Money.....,B07X841RGL

"Purchased this on 1st October. Very poor performance for a new product. There is unwanted noise from the speakers. TV mutes when I change a channel on Tata Sky set top box.

Facing Many issues with this TV 1) Data saver mode isn't available ! 2) HDMI arc support isn't working 3) AV port isn't too working 4)while connecting home theatre via Bluetooth amazon prime video isn't playing Even mi technicians are not that helpful to resolve the issues ! I feel I got defective TV,Problems with this TV,B07X841RGL
Look good. Feels good. Speakers are great for living room. Picture quality and easeness is plus point. Remote is easier to understand by elderly as well. Enough in/out port and chromecast option is welcomed. Software is obsolete and there is no update as pf yet. I like patchwall more then default android tv. I wish there was good google/chrome app there. I also use sure/zazaremote in samsung galaxy note4/note9 to act as remote and it allows keyboard input which is faster. There is small probelm near screen. Photo attached.,Best 4k hdr10 Tv for low budget (under 30k),B07X841RGL

"When we change channel in Tatasky set top box, VERY OFTEN, the sound gets muted after changing channel - Volume up/down, either in TV remote or in Tatasky remote, will not help in such situation. The way out is... switch to Netflix/Primevideo on TV, and come back to same tatasky channel by selecting HDMI - then, the sound is back. Checked if any patches/updates are available for the TV - but, it says, it is already uptodate. Request a solution for this.",Gets muted when we change channels,B07X841RGL
"Guys, the delivery from Amazon is fine and the response from them regarding the product is quite ok but the actual problem is with Installation which will be done by MI team. They will loot you and demand for extra money(you won‚Äôt have option but to pay). The MI executive came and installed TV and said as it is Movable wall mount, we charge Rs.2750 and extra amount for evening time service. When I have enquired with MI team customer care they said, only Rs.1600 will be charged including taxes for installing TV with movable wall mount. Such a rogue, he is shouting and started de-installing just because I enquired with customer care for installation rates.He said he won‚Äôt take any amount less than Rs.3000/- Even the MI team couldn‚Äôt convince the rates to its own employee, he is not at all listening to his team and started to quote his own price. Guys, think twice before you book an MI product, HORRIBLE is a small to describe their service.",Worst installation and a nightmare experience with MI service team,B07X841RGL

"Before the review....i want to tell some things.. I was very confused between Mi Vs Motorola.. I watched so many youtube videos and compared both tv Specifications... Motorola Led was little bit winner in specifications...like MEMC Technology..but it is not more useful...only for gamer who attached led with PS4 Xbox.... Here MI not revealed for Panel therefore i was too confused but friends Motorola new on Led TV Segment... where as MI Led Tv is No 1 Trusted Brand in India and also top Selling brand and they have 2000+ service centre in india....patchwall interface afterthat i decided to go with MI....*Ram Bhrose*üòÅ Now my led Comes and same day installed ...and i m very happy with this huge Led... picture quality is great if you compared with others in this price segment around 25K to 45K... you'll not be disappointed... technician told me this is TCL panel...but not sure... viewing angle is best...super brighter display... sound quality is good it's louder..do not expect digital because it has only 20w speaker...u can connect with bluetooth soundbar for cinematic experience....u guaranteed love patchwall interface because current life style we don't have times to search everything on YouTube manually....here you can enjoye infinity patchwall contents according to your mood...mini remote control is looking very good..with Netflix, Amazon Prime, Google Voice...keys....4K videos play smoothly...SD channels play v. good with HDMI cable...

"This is an excellent product from MI, the picture quality is too good and the OS is user friendly. Speech recognizing by the remote is great too. Only negative part is the sound quality. Even after pairing a Bluetooth speaker, the problem still persists, even the sound output from the external speaker decreases when paired with the TV which otherwise works fine in autonomous mode. Overall it's a great buy, i got it for 26985/- (after excluding the cash back offer as well). With regards to the installation, I saw many negative comments and reviews on this platform but i was lucky enough that my TV was installed successfully within 24 hours of its arrival. Value for money. Just go for it.",Great product with awesome picture quality but sound sucks,B07X841RGL
1.Installation support is very bad. 2. Amazon doesn't co-operates after selling the product. 3. Acko extended warantee was not provided as assured. 4. Installed apps doesent appear in list. 5.

"Amazon sale made it a wow deal at 29999/- , I got further 3000 off making it 26999/- . Bezel less display gives you large feel. Speakers are good , though while on online content sometimes for few I find sound low but 90 % times this is high . Because of inbuilt Netflix , Hotstar and prime , it is amazing to use content . I could mirror YouTube videos from my iPhone which is nice . Ultra HD videos are killer , so does full HD . Voice recognition is amazing , my 5 year old daughter loves it and uses it quite often. Overall , I cannot complaint . Go for it guys . MI has done it , heard about it and not can say that personally .",Awesome product - wow deal,B07X841RGL

"1) Picture -3.5/5 -IPS panel was expected. Though its a decent LED panel but IPS panel could have been better option to go with 50"" and above size. 2) Sound -3/5 - Could have been better. Sound Quality and Loudness are average. 3) UI and OS - 4/5 - Patchwall 2.0 with Android Official Store is Better than LG and Samsung OS and UI. 4) Installation - 4/5 - Expected Free wall mount . Installation was Free of cost and Hassle free. Mount is chargeable. Fixed wall Mount will cost you ‚Çπ499 and SWIVEL wall Mount will cost ‚Çπ1399. 5) Overall VFM - 3.5/5 - Only Drawbacks are Above Average picture quality which is Slightly lower than LG , Motorola, Samsung TV and Average sound quality. Motorola is best choice and best VFM with IPS and better Sound output under ‚Çπ35k for 50"" 4K TV and 55"" 4k under ‚Çπ40k",TV is good for price BUT was expecting a better TV with better Sound and IPS panel.,B07X841RGL
"The tv was working as intended for just 12 days after that the display got faulty( just after ten days replacement warranty has over),even though there is the warranty for the display .Mi service guys asking 25000 for the repair of the same,it all seems like a cruel joke. Do not know what to do,if you contact amazon they are diverting the call to MI service center and they are parroting the same line again and again",Tv display faulty exactly after twelve days!!! service charge 25k tv price 29k,B07X841RGL
"Fantastic is the word which can describe this TV. This is totally wireless TV. JioTV runs like a charm. You can always install AirTel xtreme TV app. If you buy MI IR cable, there is no need for any other remote. 4K quality is awesome. Only thing I felt under performing is the number of less USB ports. There are only 2, MI IR cable has occupied one and Bluetooth mouse has occupied the other. Now I cannot attach the External HDD. Wish it could have more USB ports.",MI TV is my TV,B07X841RGL
Demo is not complete,Third class service,B07X841RGL
Like: Price Dislike: picture quality is Very average. The picture frames appear to slow even when watching a 60 fps video. Whenever sequences having light or fast action it will blur out specific area. You will not get any Upscaling. Sound is also average would suggest buy a soundbar. Guys who can increase budget go for Samsung/ LG/ Panasonic/ Sharp. Guys with the same budget can consider Vu over this.,Budget TV nothing special,B07X841RGL
"Lots of positive-negative comments are here regarding MI 4X , but my overall experience is awesome with this TV either it is sound quality, picture quality or delivery/installation support. Sound quality and picture quality both are perfect , infact more than my expectations from 30k UHD TV. Dont know about other smart TV model/brand under price of 30k , but this one have dual band wifi with both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz capacity. Although I have high speed internet connection and get connected this TV by Ethernet , data saver is not an issue for me neither I tried nor I checked. Till now only problem/issue I face is that Amazon prime video with Bluetooth headphones not working in this TV , may be resolved after update. Else must buy product from MI and highly recommend to all. Thanks","Awesome product from MI, highly satisfied",B07X841RGL
This one is the best in segment smart TV but the sad thing is it does not have IPS panel and Data saving mode option is missing. Viewing angle are not up-to 178 we can notice color bleed in different angles... SD video seems not bad but HD videos has really great. I have to do manual picture settings to see good picture quality.... So called vivid mode is totally waste. One thing that disappointed me is while watching HD TV channel with Dolby digital sound on Bluetooth headset no sound can be heared ... Only after changing sound settings to PCM audio we can listen... I think in next update it will be fixed. Overall it has good built quality.,Good but know this before buying it,B07X841RGL
"1. Picture quality is amazing i am using tata sky setup box and its too good in picture quality. Also at 4k video u will truely amazed its too good with no lags depending on u r internet speed. 2. Sounds quality is also good & clear but if u want theater like experience then i will recommend to buy mi sound bar . I am sure u will love this combo. 3. Its a value for money also 1. it support Netflix, Amazon prime,hotstar,zee5 & many more. 2. the patchwall experience is good,easy interface and smooth. 3. It has built in Chromecast,screen mirror, Bluetooth, hotspot,2 themes,etc 4. Install apps from play store & don't install any app which has too many ads. 5.There is a app 'CetusPlay' in which u can get remote control,gamepad,mouse for u r t.v. in mobile for more information watch YouTube video on CetusPlay app. Some cons 1.Screen mirror has lag but not that much noticeable. 2. Same with Chromecast if the internet speed is slow it will buffer but if the speed is good then it will be fine. :- Till now i don't get any problem or more cons on this t.v. Hope it will help",Best Value For Money 4K T.v. with Good Experience,B07X841RGL
Picture quality is bright in front view. Just move 10 degree side and the picture quality changes... Not a quality product. Sound is just average. Picture quality is below average. No returns from Amazon is worst thing. Product is launched and obviously we don't get to see the product before. Features mentioned on Amazon doesn't justify.poor quality.,"Worst product, please don't buy",B07X841RGL
Bluetooth headset doesn't work along with Amazon prime!!! Sound quality is quite bad. Installation was done only 7 days after delivery since that was the earliest availability. Installer will try to sell the movable wallmount by saying you can't reach behind the TV. But actually you can reach behind even with the non movable mount.,Consider LG TVs seriously before you buy this as the customer support is non existent,B07X841RGL
"My 1st andriod tv. Was excited on the day of delivery as my old tv had stoped working 3 days ago. But the executives who had come for installation were not cooperative. I had my old tv on the wall and i asked them to just remove it and put this in that place, they said it wasnt in their policy and we are getting late to deliver other customers tv(One plus tv worth 55k) mentioning this to me. After wasting 10mins i offerred them 200Rs for it and they happily did it. Like seriously we are buying a 30k tv and getting this kind of service. And they charge 500rs for the wall mount installation. Its written in boldd letters which i saw later. total money spend Rs.30,700. Still worth it for the picture quality.",Best in this price segment. But the fitting Service is bad.,B07X841RGL
"Picture is not at all of 4k quality even when you play 4k video. MI is a cheap brand. I suggest don't buy this TV. Either MI or Amazon is fooling really. If you wanna buy a quality TV, go to a local store, check, inquire and buy. Sound is pathetic. Volume is so low even when it is played at maximum level. This is my honest review after using the product for 15 days I would rather go to a local electronic store like bajaj elec or reliance or croma instead of buying from mi or even on Amazon or even Flipkart. Please don't buy this product. Waste of money really",Not satisfied,B07X841RGL

It is a good value for money TV... Picture Quality is great...Downsides are sound and start time for me...overall is a a great TV for 30k.....I got the TV installed the same day it was delivered (thank you Amazon..I did not expect that).....I was confused with a lot of options VU Motorola TCL however I chose MI in the end the differences between all these brands are marginal only proper techies can notice it also how much you actually want to pay for a TV depends on your budget; MI for me personally has more service centres and though it may take time will service my product which I cannot be sure of the other brands I mentioned....if you a want true 4K picture buy OLED TVs from Sony LG dont buy this TV can compare....,A value for money TV,B07X841RGL
Guys pls check whether this is an LED or LCD. because when you touch the screen with your finger you can see the ripples on the screen. It should not happen for LED tv. This is cheating. Mi is marketing with lower quality which will work until guarantee period ends that's it. I don't feel it is worth for money. Im disappointed after installing the TV. Better go with some other brands adding another 4 k.,Not worth for money...,B07X841RGL
I can give a negative rating if provided. Worst user experience ever. Improve your communications with third parties.,Worst User Experience,B07X841RGL

"Dec'19 after one month of usage i liked below features: 1. Awesome Picture quality for 1080 up-scaling and 4k contents 2. UHD and HDR works for all popular content providers(netflix & Amazon Prime) 3. No 3.5 mm jack so you may have to reply on bluetooth/SPIDF/ARC for external speakers (using TP-Link HA100 I attached my old sound system to TV via bluetooth) 4. Patch wall sucks - generate recommendations whose subscriptions i don't have ( removed as primary and using default one) 5. you can connect Mouse to TV to navigate the UI 6. Using Remote control App and chrome cast feature is breeze 7. Remote lacks multiple features like mute / screen off button 8. Jio TV works but not a good thing, try ThopTV",short honest review,B07X841RGL
"Short opinion- This is probably the best 4K TV you can buy under 30K. So, go for it without any further thought. Long opinion- I got this TV in the first sale and though I was bit skeptical at first but after using it for more than a week I can say it is the best TV that I have bought. The picture quality is stunning to say the least specially when you play 4K content from YouTube app. 1080p content also looks pretty good and not pixelated. I have compared the picture quality to TCL 4K TV's but Mi was the clear winner here. Speakers are bottom firing and quite loud for a medium sized room. The audio is clear but don't expect bass. If you need bass then connect a soundbar or speaker system. S/PDIF and HDMI ARC is present, so you are covered on the audio front. Google assistant and Chromecast works flawlessly and without any lag. Since the OS is Android 9(Pie) all the apps are latest and updated frequently. Patchwall is easy to use and there is enough content for everyone to watch. Remote is somewhat similar to fire stick remote in size but with additional buttons of Google assistant, Netflix and prime video. Easy to understand and easy to use. The installation took few mins. Both the installation guy and delivery guy arrived at the same time so thumbs up for Mi installation team. Two things to note, TV doesn't come with wall mount so you will have to pay 500‚Çπ to installation guy for the wall mount and remote batteries aren't included in the package so you will have to buy them separately. It is REALLY HARD to find flaws in this TV.",Best 4K TV under 30K,B07X841RGL
"Really happy with this launch, I was about to buy Samsung in the Great Indian Festival but got to know that MI is launching this TV, was little skeptical but then changed my mind and I bought it. And guess what , I took the right decision , its an awesome TV and got me 20k rupees saved in comparison to Samsung for the same item...Durability is still a question to me but cant comment on that as of now....will review again after at least 6 months of uses. Go for it if your budget is around 30k....best in the market","50"" 4k TV at this price (unbelievable)",B07X841RGL
So i want to start this review by saying that this tv is total bang for bucks the tv is super snappy and fast. I mostly use this tv for gaming on my PS4 and the games looks good i can say i previously had a mi tv 4a 43 inch and it does not support hdr but this tv does so a plus point for that even the picture quality is pretty good for this price i watched some 4k movies and they look good. If were to nit pick i can say that the speakers are bad yes they do not sound that good i can even say that the previous mi tv sounded better than this tv. I don't know what is wrong with the speakers but they sound quite boring. Anyways i think you can go for this tv i don't regret buying this tv for this price.,A balanced tv with more pros and less cons. #bangforbucks,B07X841RGL
Picture quality was not that good(contrast is more) and 4k videos are not playing in proper speed(stuck in between) in screen mirroring and I got TV WITH SOME DEAD PIXEL so I returned it.... Sound quality is not good and little slow,Quality is not good,B07X841RGL

"Updates: 1. The remote power button issue was due to some HDMI / CEC setting. It is sorted now. Google's Android TV Design team should show what the impact of changing a Setting is. 2. The no - audio issue is not as frequent anymore. 3. The audio output when connected to external speakers is weirdly bad. The audio given out by my Fire Stick over Bluetooth is much much better, both in terms of quality & volume, than when my TV gives the audio out to the same external speakers (same issue via Bluetooth and S/PDIF). ---- After thinking a lot to decide between TCL iFfalcon, Motorola, Vu and Mi TVs, I decided to go ahead with the Mi. My idea was Mi is a reasonably respected brand, and they have a lot of service centres. TV is something I will use for a long period of time, and I want the brand to exist to service in the long term. WHAT I LIKED: 1. The colors on the TV seem fairly good. 2. The audio quality seemed quite good too (I watch from ~ 8 ft). 3. The remote is well laid out and is nice to use. 4. It comes with a S/PDIF digital audio output. With more expensive speakers, you can easily connect you‚Äôll need to purchase a digital to analog converter (DAC) to connect most 2.1 speakers. WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER: 1. Less than 3 weeks, and the Power button on the Remote stopped working. This is disappointing. (FIXED) 2. The TV sometimes stops playing audio. To fix it, I have to restart the TV. (ALMOST FIXED) 3. With the TV connected to my Bluetooth speakers, sometimes there is a lag. 4. The content from my 1080p Fire Stick & 1080p Chromecast looks bad on the TV. Must be an upscaling issue. Surprisingly, content from the same devices looks much better on a friend‚Äôs 55 inch Mi 4K TV. 5. There is no 3.5mm audio jack on the TV.",Picture quality & Audio are good.,B07X841RGL
Very fast delivery and loved the picture quality. Overall i liked it. Thanks amazon and mi,I loved it,B07X841RGL
"I bought the Mi TV 4X 50' from on flash sale. Got it during the second time I got opportunity after being waitlisted. It was a good deal for a 50' TV. After the discount + cashback in the credit card the price was Rs. 26900. I‚Äôve been using this TV for the past two weeks and I must say it‚Äôs the most value for money gadget I‚Äôve ever spent on! In 2008 or so we bought a 26' LCD TV for Rs. 25000. Technology has advanced so fast and see how is the market nowadays. Key Points and my views on that #1 - 4K LED Panel: The quality of picture is very good. It is a VA panel and the color reproduction and the viewing angles are good. I was pretty much concerned how it will turn out, due to the viewing angle reviews of VA panel. Even though it is inferior than IPS displays, you wont feel that much issues in dat to day usage. 4K and even the 1080p videos were awesome in it. Definitely you will have issues with fast moving videos (eg: sports), where in you will experience few missing frames. MEMC feature is missing in the 50' version. You will have to opt for the 65' version for that case. Vivid mode will be loved by those who like their videos to be highly saturated. #2 - Design: WOW factor is missing from design point of view. It is not the slimmest of the TVs from Mi as well. It is just OK. #3 - PatchWall: The TV has PatchWall 2.0 which is an improvement considering the previous version. The content is fetched from multiple apps and if you have subscription to most of them then it will be easy to guide through rather than opening each of them separately. The Android TV interface is also present and we can easily switch to that with a dedicated button in the remote. #4 - Sensy TV: I would recommend you invest an additional Rs. 300 for the Mi IR cable as well. When you add the IR Cable to your TV & STB, you can browse your DTH channels using the TV remote. The set up procedure is available in YouTube. Once done it is really helpful. #5 - Sound: The speakers are the same 20W type and it is good enough for living room. If you are bass lover its good to invest in a sound bar. I have a soundbar with sub-woofer from Sony, and luckily it has Bluetooth option. The connectivity options are pretty limited in Mi TV, either your sound bar should support HDMI, SPDIF or Bluetooth. So please be careful if you buy a low cost soundbar. Analog audio out is missing. #6 - Apps: Prime video & Netflix is supported natively (dedicated buttons are also present in the remote) as well as Google Play store is present. In case any apps are missing in the Playstore you can always sideload it. #7 - Processor & Memory: Processor seems to be decent for now. The Memory is on the lower side compared to competitors. It should have been improved At 29,999 INR, and the loads of features, it‚Äôs a steal and everyone is rushing to grab one.","Its a real steal deal, great value for money",B07X841RGL
"Dear Guys, Hello.. Please find my review as hereunder after minutely observing almost a month. I believe that it will be really helpful for all of you. I have tried my level best to cover each point in this review. 1. Build quality is good. It is not metallic but quite impressive. No complain. 2. Picture quality is very good. In order to feel the real charm of watching TV, at least 720p is required. Full HD/4k looks great and stunning. 3. Speaker output is good. Do not expect high bass. But trust me it is good enough for a room (16x16 feet). 4. Remote control is very responsive but you need good speed of internet to work it smoothly. 5. Patchwall 1.0 version. No update till date. 6. User interface of TV is quite impressive and friendly. 7. There is no lag while operation of TV. 8. Google voice assistant works great. But you need good speed of internet. Commands identification is really awesome. 9. No need to use TATA/Airtel/any DTH service. Please use high speed of internet (highly recommended to use fiber) and take subscription of Sony Liv, Hotstar, amazon prime, netflix. You will really feel amazing and wonderful experience of watching TV. 10. There is no 3.5mm jack. 11. One Ethernet port is given. 12. Please use V guard stabilizer (as per your load) in order to avoid any PCB damage. 13. Do not press the TV panel. It will deteriorate the life of panel. Some reviewers said it is not fixed properly. But trust me this is not affecting picture quality or watching TV experience anyhow. 14. Minimum 7 feet distance is required for watching 720p or 1080p/i channels. 15. Viewing angle is not very great since it is VA panel. But it is in acceptable range. Do not worry for that. If you are satisfied with my review. Please like it. It will encourage me to review other products. Happy shopping. Best Regards..",Amazing TV For Such A Good Price,B07X841RGL
"I am writing this review after using for 1 week 1. Build quality Build quality looks good. Nice design, all accessible ports, simple LED indicator and power button in the bottom bezel, thinner bezels. But stand is light weight plastic, tv shakes for toch or movements. I feel its unstable and may fall I handled carelessly on table top. 2. Display let's kkt talk about type and tech of panel. Compared to many other TV in this range I feel this is best for price. Blacks are not deep and appear grey. HDR 10 is great, brightness is little low with lot of inhouse lighting/daylight but not a problem. 4K content shows amazing. 3. Audio Sound is decent, not much bass Very loud back firing speakers Dolby digital sound is noticeable in HD channels and HD content. You might need sound system or sound bar if you want more immersive experience 4. Android /Patchwall I liked patcwall more than android. It has bigger icons, all OTT content visible on home screen and doesn't require multiple apps or searching much. Easy to navigate and very smooth. All the Inputs are displayed so no need to goto setting to change AV inputs Like in android. Google assistant doesn't search on patcwall but only in android TV home. Some features I found worth mentioning Vivid picture mode will increase the picture quality and more colors I hope MI will bring more improvements in future Sound modes are useless I prefer custom adjustments It supported my 2TB hard disk without any lags and smooth navigation. In built Video player is useless, download VLC which has more features and plays all videos without lag. Bluetooth remote is boon easy to use fast and could use in any direction and from upto 6-7 metres as I tried. 4.5gb user available ROM is less I felt but can use a Pendrive also as inbuilt storage. No branding or symbol on TV bezels. It supports sensi remote with which we can use set top box and TV with same remote (should purchase separately) A very happy purchase during this Dasara, I recommend this TV to others. Save money and purachse other gifts üòÖ",Top in the class,B07X841RGL

"Update :-Ext Warranty:- As promised I got the 1 year ext warranty doc over email which was part of the festival offer, great job by Amazon. Delivery : worst, delhivery agent tried to get the shipment in a open truck on a monsoon season, very bad, luckily received the package without any water damage. Thought of returning the shipment back. Installation : one day delay because of rain, just simple inspection and installing the stand. About the product, in a simple word, value for money, for 30k it's more than that. I couldn't find any problem with sound or picture quality for 4k/1080p contents. Other contents looks not impressive. All ports are working no screen issues, the UI is not bad. If your budget is 30K, then don't look around. Go for it.",You get what you paid for.,B07X841RGL

"Stills and slow motion videos are brilliant.. but fast action scenes are JUDDERING.. motion blur is very visible in fast scenes like running, car chase fights etc.. very eye straining. Xbox one gaming lags due to high response time of 9.5ms. my 2 year old sanyo 50inch FHD is 3time smooth with no lags at all. Patchwall is also lagging. Sometime you need to press same button twice.. you won't get the smoothness like fire TV stick with this tv. Overall - motion blur/lags makes runes viewing experience. Even if you pause the video the screen seems flickering (may be bad led backlight in my tv) Picture/color/resolution - 5/5 Video/Xbox one gaming - 2/5 Sound -3.5/5 Remote - 1/5 - no mute button, TV remote don't control ARC HDMI devices like home theater/fire stick etc. NO refund policy - only replacement.",Jiggering / motion blur,B07X841RGL
"So before buying the MI 50 inch tv, I surveyed Panasonic, VU, LG, and Sony tv. I would say its picture quality is comparable to entry-level LG AI Thin q tv but with few backdrops that I would like to discuss here. First, let's talk about Cons: 1) The TV is not that bright. Lg entry-level tv (The one that costs 50k- 60K for 50 inches) is a little brighter than this tv maybe 10 percent brighter but LG nano cell tv 2019 (cost around1 lakhs for 55 inch) is easily 60- 70 percent brighter and having punchy colors. 2) Screen is reflective Like many cost-effective TVs, The screen is very reflective. Probably more than VU. You will see a tube light reflection on the screen during dark scenes. So that is quite annoying. 3) Youtube skips audio at 4K I am having a 100 Mbps speed connection but when I play Youtube at 4k it skips the sound. Possibly due to the small buffer size allocated to the Youtube app. Now, That might be solved by an update because I didn't face any issue playing UHD/4k Video on Netflix or Prime. 4) Picture settings You have to recalibrate the picture quality while playing HDR content because your standard picture setting would be too dark. So I have to manually shoot the brightness to 75 and backlight to 100 to enjoy the HDR content. Expensive TVs recalibrate themselves as per the content but here you have to do it yourself 5) Lack of 3.5 audio jack I guess everyone is already aware but I have just mentioned beause I am having a legacy music system. Now I guess you are aware of the pros but still: 1)Price: At 27,000 (after discount), you can barely complain about it. My friend bought a 49-inch sony tv for rs 85000 and Of course, Sony is quit bright with punchy colors but mi tv is 1/3rd the price. It is value for money. Further, in 2 -3 years Qled or 8K tv might become mainstream so you might want to save bucks for them. Apps: I can play all apps like Netflix, Prime Video, Sonyliv, Hotstar, VOOT, Jio cinema, PLEX. But apps like Amazon Music and chrome browser or any browser is not available to download from the play store. And I haven't tried sideloading them as of now. At this price, I am happy with the TV and you will be too. If you are a videophile with 1 lakh rs, go buy LG nano cell 55-inch latest model.",Don't buy before reading this,B07X841RGL

"Amazing product by MI The order was delivered withing a day of placing order. Installation was done at the same time as delivery (both persons came together), so there was zero down time between delivery and installation/demo. The picture quality is amazing. I have another 50 inch 4k smart shinco tv bought 6 months back at around the same price, but the picture quality is as different as night and day (MI has much better quality) Sound quality is pretty good. Voice is pretty clear and sound effects are good. There are sufficient connections available (hdmi, usb etc), but that is the same as what every brand is offering these days. Netflix, amazon prime and hotstar work perfectly. The remote is sleek and has a premium look (though it only features the essential buttons, a change from the usual remotes which have a button for everything) The only issue i have faced is that there is no direct way to reach usb/hard disk. You can open those using video players, but no way to directly choose the source. It is more of a interfsce issue, which might be corrected during future updates. Overall, i feel this is a great buy. Much better than competing brands at similar price points.",Amazing product. Strongly recommended,B07X841RGL

"Amazon service has been ridiculousright from installation to service you provided on my issue with tv. I asked to return the product and there was an inspection arranged the technician saw issue and said that this I can ask for a replacement but he submitted report to Amazon saying everything is good. Then I called customer service and they arranged second inspection but this time no technician showed up, I got calls from two different technicians and both asked on what the issue is, also the second person asked me to forward a video that I recorded on WhatsApp, at the end no one showed up. This the worst service across all e-commerce platforms I have experienced. I would not purchase anything expensive from Amazon going forward and will share my story with people in my network. Product is average. Issue with patchwall, no resolution provided even by Xiaomi. What they mention on website about 80% content being free is incorrect. Picture is not that great.",Worst customer service from Amazon,B07X841RGL
"Pros 1. Picture quality is very good. 2. Viewing angle is great 3. build quality is above average ( cannot expect more at this price) Cons ( would say MI need to improve the quality ) 1. remote is very sensitive, a little touch on the remote would switch app or increase volume 2. audio is just average, watching an action movie would be horrible. 3. There is no optical out or 3.5 mm jack . so, connecting the tv to audio system will be a pain. 4. Port positioning could have been better, once you wall mount then its very tough to reach the component and ethernet port. Biggest problem with the TV is , randomly the apps would crash (netflix, youtube and zee5) and you would get irritated once you fast forward or rewind on Prime Video,because after that complete audio and video would be out of sync and play pause wont work for the playback. @mi get the latest apk from prime video which would fix the audio video sync issue and play/pause issue",Great value for money but comes with few compromises,B07X841RGL
"This is my second mi tv,the previous one was the 55 inch tv 4 pro... This particular model uses a 10bit panel,which is a considerable improvement. Storage memory should have been 16gig atleast.2 gigs of ram is fine. Sound @20 watts speaker is ok,better to use a home theatre. Bluetooth connectivity is an added advantage.many budget brands lack this even today. Netflix and prime comes out of the box with dedicated buttons on remote Tv as such is very light due to its plastic body.bezels are sufficiently slim. The remote is something i dislike. very minimalistic and a measure to cut costs. It has google assistant and the voice assistant functionality works fine. Mi doest even provide the batteries. There is no dedicated mute button. Would prefer an additional air remote. No optical and 3.5 mm audio outputs. Hdmi arc saves the day in a few cases.not in mine though. Wall mount is chargeable @rs500 extra. It is not a flagship tv,but it does tick many boxes at this price point. In my personal opinion i feel mi as a brand is better than many other budget brands like kodak, thomson,tcl and others. So atleast after sales support shouldnt be a problem.",Good for the price with a few ommissions,B07X841RGL

Anyone can install tv no need to ask for installation as no proof is provided by installer, it's a kind of Mi honey trap.","No warranty void on self installtion, Mi is giving wrong info.",B07X841RGL

"I am writing this review after a week's use. I purchased in the very first flash sale on 28th Sept. Got it delivered on 4th of Oct. The installation was superfast, the technician came within two hours. Now the actual review : 1. Picture : The panel is not as bright as Sony or as vivid as Samsung but hey it can give a tough competition to other 4K TVs especially because of its aggressive pricing or should i say ""honest pricing "". Anyways the 4K videos are a delight to watch on this tv. Though the brightness of the panel is on a lower side but that is not a deal breaker. Overall it delivers more than price. 2. Sound : Sound is fair enough for a big hall. Though it lacks the crispness and bass. But if you pair it with a good quality sound bar the sound is pretty nice. 3. OS: The TV runs on Android TV and on top of it MI's custom UI Patchwall. I preferred Patchwall more in this TV though in my earlier 4C Pro I preferred Stock Android. MI team has really worked hard to make Patchwall more user friendly. It is fluid and fast. Though I was really disappointed with the courier service, the TV is worth every penny you spend. So just go for it.",Superb Purchase... Worth Every Penny,B07X841RGL
"Display : 4/5 The pannel is bright and crisp. Although anyone using Set top box won't like the clarity much. I do recommend HD set top box for best clarity. Audio: 2/5 Sound isn't the best considering the competition. Connectivity : 3/5 Connectivity is alright. Although when you have your router past 70m, the TV struggles a bit. Value for money: 4/5 Considering the price, it's the best 4k pannel you can buy. The TV is capable of playing 4k content without much hussle. Blacks are good. I do recommend to sit a little away from the tv to get the best viewing experience. All in all a good product for the budget.",Honest opinion,B07X841RGL
Purchased the TV on first sale..delivery in 2 days same day installation - Awesome. Picture quality is Awesome mainly when stretching the low quality video to full size. TV is slow when opening apps and loading videos.some times apps are crashing. May be next version requires a better processor and more ram like their mobile section.

"I bought MI 4X TV 4K 50inch. It's good experience. Everyone likes this TV in my home. I will add few pics here for your reference and my observations. 1) Cheap and best... If your budget is less than 40k or 50k, please go for this. Because what ever big brands available in market less than 50k, don't expect this all features as well as that was launched one or two year before may be... 2) I was done lots of market study, my budget was below 50k, I sorted big brands like sony, samsung and Lg brands but finnaly i understood this big brands selling their basic and older version in less than 50k. Picture Quality: It is more than my expectation in 30K. Attached pictures are proof. I played many 4K videos. As well Airtel HD channels and SD (standerd channels) also. I thought may SD channels won't get good clarity. But it's beyond my expectations. It's also looking good in this TV. Sound quality: Don't expect 5.1 or Dolby X.or Atmos here. Your will get better sound but voice clarity is less and sometimes need to increase volume . Remember this 4K 50inch in 30k. My suggestion go for one sound bar yamaha/ Polk. Value for money: 100%",My Review after 3rd week.,B07X841RGL
The product was delivered to me on time. The installation was scheduled the next day which happened without any hassle. The installation guy was very coperative and answered all my queries. The picture and sound quality of the tv is perfect for home use. There is no need for external speakers. I think a 50 inch 9.0 android tv at 30k price range is a definite go.

"Know before you buy, there's a major software problem in the TV that keeps it from rendering true dolby audio, the dolby decoding library breaks on a Dolby input and the audio just mutes. Can be verified via any true dolby audio source ( viz. Windows 10 Netflix app connected via HDMI, Tata sky by making sure the audio is set to Dolby digital or Dolby digital Plus from user settings or any other). This might not sound as bad (no pun intended) but just gave me a nerve wrecking 3 hour unboxing experience which ended finally when i pulled the tv's logcat to see what was really happening which filled up the whole log with errors from the dolby library failing in buffer errors. Other than that the picture quality is great for the price, sound is also satisfactory and the build quality is also not that bad.",Dolby audio library broken in the TV's OS... Ok otherwise.,B07X841RGL
mi products very poor quality and mi team very very very poor service,mi products,B07X841RGL
They have pathetic service for installation and even more poor customer service. We had ordered mi TV via their platform. Although we had set up for installation and received confirmation nobody turned up and the customer support did nothing but raise a query with their team asking us to wait for 24 hours for service engineer. Also we can't install it ourselves as the warranty would be void. No matter how the tv is their service spoils the whole experience and would not recommend this product to any one.,Poor customer service,B07X841RGL
