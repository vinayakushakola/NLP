This is the 2nd 32 inch smart LG TV I am buying the first one stopped working after 3 months some issue with the electrical adaptor. After 3 months of no response from LG customer care I thought its easier to buy a new TV. Made the mistake picked up the same TV thinking the previous may be one off. The new TV LG customer care came and installed the audio was not working they blamed the tata sky set top box and said get it fixed. Now tata sky technicians came and validated that their settop box audio is perfectly fine on other TV and this LG 32 TV has a issue. Big disappointment 2 times on amazon two times defective model was shipped. Not sure what's the issue but definitely makes online shopping experience bad. Totally disappointing please donot by LG products they seem to have overgrown the trust they once held,LG 32 smart TV Avoid!!!!,B07TMFQMJC
It is probably the best budget smart TV around with a brand name. I have been using it for about a month now and my thoughts are below The best thing about this product is it's price but don't buy it if you are looking for a premium product. The low points of the product is highlighted below 1) Sound quality is not good if you are planning to place the TV in the living room I will suggest you add a speaker for clarity 2) the smart features are not impressive with no screen cast support for Android .The web browser UI is not ideal but manageable. 3) the remote for this TV is not best built with a very long sequence required to increase brightness or picture quality. Also the absence of YouTube button is also not convenient.,Good product for it's price range,B07TMFQMJC
"I bought it for 16500 from Amazon during offer period Amazon 5/5 Picture quality:5/5:lg brand is known for its lot of new software such as WEBos .. Sound amazing: 20w speaker gives u a chill effect Smart :connect with Ur mobile and play hotstar,mx player and movies from Ur mobile to big screen BEST BRANDED UNDER smart TV under 20000..go for it.LG never disappoint..AND MAKES UR HOME GOOD",Amazon well done..LG.BRAND THAT GIVE TOUGH COMPETITION FOR SONY,B07TMFQMJC
In this TV reflectors are fall inside the TV that gives dots on screen. The glue used in this TV was low quality so it is not preferable. See youtube videos for dot in LG TV,One major problem on LG tv,B07TMFQMJC

"Before buying this tv plz read out my review 1. Its not android tv, it’s webOS tv which is developed by LG itself. 2. Don’t expect for live tv 3. All the apps will not be installed 4.display clarity and sound is good 5. Hotstar, jio tvand soni liv shall not be operated but it may be through google chromecast bcz m not sure",Good tv with bad OS,B07TMFQMJC
"I have like the TV and smart tv option. It's been very user-friendly for me, but I am little disappointed with the description .It was mentioned as magic remote but received different but picture quality is not up to the mark of sony picture quality.",Lg Smart tv bought it very best rate.,B07TMFQMJC
"I'm using it from Feb 3, 2019. This is a very nice product from LG. This product is a 2017 model and that is why price is very reasonable. But I think It hardly matters whether it is 2017 or 2018 model. I asked at LG showroom, they told the price will be around 28k. But I got it from Amazon in 21k. Smart features are working nicely . Youtube app, Netflix and Amazon Prime app is working fine . But after Tv installation these apps might ask for upgradation. So You need to updated all apps after connecting wifi or LAN connection. Web browser of this TV is quite good. U can open any website through this browser. But might take little longer to load any video streaming website!! I'm using my broadband wifi and it has connected properly. LAN cable option is also there. TV has a good user manual app installed in it by which you can easily find out how to use this TV. this is very helpful. Miracast screen share option is quite effective for this TV. You need to install an app from Play store in your Smartphone. And need to register your TV with serial No in this APP. and then you can share your mobile's galley, videos etc in the TV. But remember you can't able to copy files or folders from your mobile to TV. Only You can share the screen. This TV does not comes with a magic remote! Overall very good product. I would recommend this product.",Nice Product . Smart features . very good Picture and Sound quality!,B07TMFQMJC
Awesome purchase. Got it for 16500. Great service by amazon. Delivered on time. Got it installed same day by LG. Had to call LG for the installation. Picture and Sound is great. Connectivity and Smart Features are working properly.,Great Purchase,B07TMFQMJC
The product is good but instead supplying magic remote as promised only ordinary lg remote was supplied which is not fair by company like lg,Good tv,B07TMFQMJC
"After a month of usage Installation was free with wall mount & was installed the same day evening. Display was brilliant more like Sony. Google Chrome browser helps you to browse everything like PC. Not android but good comparatively good. With apps available on Lg app store. Comes with just one year warranty as we buy online. If stores outside it comes with three years by default. Supports many video formats like mp4, divx also. With extra 3 to 4 thousand you can get voice activated remote control in other Lg model as this was just an normal remote no Google assistant",Best TV,B07TMFQMJC
"Oh the choices we have these days. From HD ready to 4k, thanks to surplus cash in hand, zero interest EMI and Chinese manufacturing. And what do we have in hand? A few HD channels and majority of it in SD broadcast (mind it, the 4:3 vintage quality). So when 576i source is amplified into full HD (not even 4k) in our large screen chinese imports(or Indian assembles), what we get is immersive, yet immensely dull rendering as you watch it from a distance. That's where 32"" tv comes handy. You gotta sit close, like 5-6 feet and that's the best compromise. Those who rely mainly on SD content, get this. The upscaling to HD screen is much better than in the other brands. Choice is between 'dull, large screen' vs 'small(32), crisp images'. I went for the latter. Yes, picture is sharp. Bright. Vivid. By that, i mean nothing life-like. Life is dull and boring, remember? We apply instagram filters to make it rich, it's the same here. You can dull it all down if you want in the settings. But yeah, the tv is a joy to watch. Much have been berated about the sound, I don't find room to complain anymore. The modern human want the most powerful car with the highest fuel efficiency. He seem to believe that he can get everything- use your brain for a while- a compact package would only give little room for the speakers, so how much loud can they really be? It is good for a bedroom or a small living room. There's lack of bass, but audio and music sounds much clear. There is also a clear voice mode. Think of it as an expanded phone speaker- serves the purpose. There's ample smart apps and there's also a HDR mode even for non-HD content- not sure what it does to the picture, haven't tested enough. Power consumption is a humble 45W (this at full backlight/contrast, will go down if you reduce it ) so you can run it on your home UPS all day. There's less heat from the back. TV starts within seconds and displays the hdmi input (dth box, in my case) which is so much of a + over the cheap android tvs. Pen drive plays hevc content too! That's a +. Of course, impeccable quality with HD and full HD content. Around 15k INR, what you get is a 50% higher priced LG than the TCL, Vu equivalent, but what you also get is the peace of mind of owning a brand that actually provides a warranty service. It's like buying a toyota. You would only realize the premium paid in the long term ownership. It's small, but it's a joy to watch.","for SD only content, this is more than enough.",B07TMFQMJC
I have 50 inch Samsung purchased 2 years back for Rs 80000 and Sony Bravia 32 inch 5 yrs back for Rs 35000 and now purchased this TV for Rs 14999 with 1000 cashback in amazon pay. I can say at this price this TV is just amazing. Its value for money. Trust me I find picture quality and sound quality of this TV better than my Samsung and Bravia,Just wow,B07TMFQMJC

"After using for 1 week I am giving this review. Picture quality is very good. Sound is low in standard mode. If we setup sound in DTS virtual x mode then sound is good. When watching content through internet sound is amazing. Chromecast is ok. You can even use LG TV plus app for this purpose. Remote is ok, typing is difficult but using mobile remote (LG TV plus app) makes the job a little easier. Wall mount has been delivered free of cost by installation person. No papers given for 3 year warranty. Installation process may be given to a third party by Lg. So your installation experience will depend on the type of person coming for installation. Demo given was incomplete installation person was in hurry he did not give proper information. LG must take review on installation persons. Call LG customer care directly as soon as the product was delivered and keep following till installation. Product is excellent for tight budgets. Try to utilise all the discounts being given by Amazon while purchasing this product.",Good product at low price,B07TMFQMJC
"Picture is bit tinted, whites are not pure white. Overall very average picture quality, not expected from reputed brand like LG. Or perhaps that's because it's HD ready, not full HD.

Casting mobile screen is not very smooth even though I have 300 Mbps wifi router, video stutters and lags.",Just ok kind of product,B07TMFQMJC

Product is nice ..no issue. But never buy from.cloudtail as they induce u to buy by providing wrong information. At the time of purchase it was mentioned that it cover 3 year comprehensive warranty for places other than kerala for purchase upto 31.10.2019.

Check with brand before rely on cloudtail,B07TMFQMJC

I had purchase this TV on Diwali sale. And once i received the TV. There were my relative also who requested me to order the same. This TV cost me around 12500 with all discount and pay balance. The performance of the TV is good. I use to watch Netflix and Amazon Prime on the TV. that gives me a good picture quality. But the sound quality is not so much up to the mark. Also there was no Bluetooth support in the TV. This little dissatisfy me. Over the product is worth buying if you are OK without Bluetooth.,Good product but Missing Bluetooth,B07TMFQMJC

"One of the best buy! Quality is very nice, smart tv option works smooth. Rating are below as after 7 months use Picture quality 5/5 Smart tv 5/5 Looks 5/5 Sound quality 4/5 ( sound quality is good only the problem is less bass and less volume.",Rating are below as after 7 months use.,B07TMFQMJC
"Got it for 17889 excluding another 3k in cashback. Worth the actual price though. YouTube and Amazon Prime works too good. Mobile screen casting also works good. Best thing IMO would be you can operate the same with LG Mobile app, WiFi connected and doesn't requires IR blaster. Best viewing distance would be 6-8 feet away. What didn't work well for me is the Amazon coordinated free installation. I had to call LG and get it installed, however that happened within 24 hours for free. Personally didn't care about HDMI port as said by others as casting from mobile phone works. LG does sends you software updates if any and it gets I stalled without any pain.",Worth the actual cost,B07TMFQMJC
"I was in two minds while ordering this led smart tv bt always have faith in amazon & also lg so buy it in 21990 rs ,have to say its worth the money spent, delivery was on time ,installation was fast 5 stars for installation guy.

"I waited for a week to review this product just to see how it works out and I have to say it is great from all ways. I received the product one day before expected date, and the LG service eas so spontaneous at my installation request that they sent the mechanic in less than 12 hours. Speaking about the TV, it is magnum at the price of its offered at. Picture quality is to good and navigation is good. The only drawback is the absence of Hotstar App as well as a magic remote as it becomes a bit difficult to control a smart TV without a Magic Remote.",Magnum Budget SmartTV,B07TMFQMJC

Its best hd ready smart tv for this range. Wifi easily connect you can watch Netflix , prime etc. Picture quality is little bit down although all ok . Since its hd ready clarity is good.

"Got this in Rs.13,999 + 10% OFF at https://amzn.to/36Rayck & extra 3 years of warranty. Its the best budget smart TV by the best brand. With IPS panel, video quality is perfect. Sound quality is fine. But, still need to add speakers for clarity. Happy with its smart features. color, brightness, contrast like things are good. Viewing angle is fine. It doesn't have Android so you have to manage to increase brightness or picture quality. But YouTube app, Netflix and Amazon Prime app is working fine. Miracast screen share option is not quite effective. But can't ask for more in this price. Product is excellent for tight budgets. PROS and CONS from my side though: Pros: 1. Overall performance is good. 2. Picture and Sound quality is great. 3. Build quality is good. 4. Connectivity and Smart Features are working properly. 5. Easy access to Netflix, YouTube, Amazon prime, Hotstar and lots of other apps. 6. Colors rendered are pretty well. 7. Screen mirroring is fine. Cons: 1. Only one USB port given. 2. White or Black colors on screen are not pure whites or blacks. 3. Refresh rate is just 50hz so feels lag in sport videos or gaming experience. My advice is to go for TCL 4K UHD - https://amzn.to/2P4JPm8 if you can afford more for even more performance classy looks and quality.",14K for LG 32 Inch is Good Deal,B07TMFQMJC

On LG TV ads and site they show different application but due to area continent it restricted. Why there are giving such false info. Mobile sharing is not best. micro-cast mobile technology is poor. smart remote is good but no used. No screenshot taken, even live tv is not enable. After a 2 years Display stop working. thank to TaTa sky TV is on mobile to. Now LED or LCD is not for longer run. I will recommend OLD technology we say DUBBA technology. hahaha. Well another recommend no smart TV with HD ready technology. we can use Amazon fire stick for youtube or app. it will fill smart tv apps. only required USB and some good ports on TV panel.

"This is a best buy by LG in this price point. So here's the overview: 1. Picture: The picture quality is good with different option available. If you are using a set up box, then it would be better if you upgrade from SD to HD. 2. Sound: The sound from the TV crisp and clear and 10W speakers are loud enough for your home. No need of buying additional soundbars or speakers. 3. Smart Features: It is a WebOS TV and not an Android one therefore, inspite of 1GB RAM there are no lags while switching between apps. Connecting to WiFi and external sources are very easy and work very well. The internal storage here is around 500MB which is enough for normal use. The TV can be easily connected and controlled with LG TV Plus app with screen casting and content playing features ( wherein you can play photos, videos and music directly from your phone). 4. Magic Remote: No magic remote is provided with so no magic remote means no voice input that means you literally have to type everything (which is a bit boring!!!). 5. TV Apps: The TV comes with pre loaded apps such as Netflix, Hotstar, Amazon Prime, ErosNow, Hungama etc. Well there is no Youtube and Spotify but you can easily download them from LG content store. And you need to update all apps when you start for the first time. You can even uninstall pre loaded apps if you want. This is the best TV if you are just upgrading from your age old CRT's to LED TV, as there is no point in spending more money and buying a non smart LED TV. Prompt delivery by Amazon and the same day installation by LG.",Best In This Price Point,B07TMFQMJC
