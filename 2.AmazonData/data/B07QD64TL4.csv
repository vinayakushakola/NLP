"Using TV for about one month. TV audio, video works fine. One problem that I felt that you cannot change language of a dual audio file when played from USB. Checking from Customer care , they said this option is available in higher ranges of TV ( SMART TV) . So when buying a basic LED TV keep this in mind.",No dual audio support,B07QD64TL4
Sony still sells at a premium and a decent service is expected. Seems Sony has also tied up with local vendors and is not able to control their service quality. Shame. No one has turned up for installation even after confirmation. Waiting for installation... Shall put in more reviews once product is operational...,Useless service inspite of paying a premium for Sony,B07QD64TL4
