"Have 40"" sony which is 40k 55"" MI which is 45k, Full HD projector around 70k. All these are value for money but this one seems to be more than value that I paid. Wanted to use in room and works as expected, Sound was something I was worried but this easily can provide better sound. Picture clarity to my surprise is good. Havent tried pen drive and other options. Can be really used for smaller rooms and can be a good stand by TV. Worth every rupee. Only thing that needs be seen durability. 2 years run will surely get back the money I invested. Good buy and happy to buy.",What you expect for 4.5k?,B079ZSFJRG
"I had earlier posted about the bad sound of the TV. Well after complaining, the manufacturer has replaced the product with a new one within 10 days, and the TV is working absolutely fine. No doubts on the picture quality and sound now. It has great quality at this rate.",Replaced and satisfied,B079ZSFJRG
Display panel is loose and tv light is coming out from black border. I visited the place yesterday found the defect. Don't know if customer care will replace it.,"Low quality product, you need to be lucky to get full working tv.",B079ZSFJRG
"TV is no where near a LED Tv resolution; it is at best comparable to a backlit LCD, which I suspect it might actually be! Absolutely horrible picture quality, with pixels showing up in movies and video games. Sound quality is not at all satisfactory either, lots of echo. Worse is that Amazon REFUSED to give refund even though I have reported multiple defects with the TV! Amazon customer service is horrendous, so I would actually recommend anyone NOT to buy this product at all, especially from Amazon. Horrible experience, thanks to Amazon!","Horrible Picture, not even same as LCD, Avoid buying!",B079ZSFJRG
"FIRST IMPRESSION WAS HOW LIGHT IT WAS LIKE A FEATHER BECAUSE LAST TV IS ALSO OF 24'' BUT TOO HEAVY BUT WHEN I UNBOXED KEVIN 24'' I WAS REALLY FELT VERY LIGHT . AND THE PICTURE QUALITY IS ALSO GOOD COMPARED TO FEW OTHER BRANDS AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS SOUND OUTPUT ITS REALLY GOOD LIKE A SOUND BAR , AS I TOOK THIS TV FOR MY PARENTS WHO LIKE SMALL TV FOR THEIR BEDROOM IT SUITS FOR MY BUDGET AND OVER ALL A WELL DESIGNED PRODUCT FOR AFFORDABLE PRICE.",AFFORDABLE TELEVISION,B079ZSFJRG
"Bought this TV (32"") on 3rd Jan, 2019 for the price of 8399. Before I begin with the detailed product review I would like to talk about delivery and installation. Amazon, as usuall delivered the product on time with scheduled delivery and product unboxing and verification on spot by the delivery agent. Installation: We need to call kevin customer care for installation request.I read lot of reviews taking about how bad the installation service was but in my case the installation was done on the same day of raising the request (for free). kudos to kevin for that.Kevin has a 3rd party service provider for installation which is Jeeves they are a professional repair n installation company so we can expect professional service from them. Now coming to the TV first things first the picture quality is not bad for the price. Colors are a little saturated but otherwise its quite good. Sound is suffecient for a small to medium room and quality is fine.The Panel is unbelievably light weight but build quality is not too bad but again for the price of course. You can't compare this tv with the likes of Sony, or LG for obvious reasons but for the price of 8k its a fine product indeed. Just go for it... Happy purchasing... :)",Worth Every Penny...!Go For It...,B079ZSFJRG
love it.....awesome sound and superb quality hd channels with hd dish set top box. and the normal channels are also good but sound i must say awesome ....worth budget money purchase,8k@10% discount ....really super tv and better than branded one i saw in physical store,B079ZSFJRG
"I bought it at Rs. 6,550/- from Amazon. Like everybody else, I believed that unless you buy a big Korean or Japanese brand TV, you can't be a 100% certain of it's quality. But on my brother's persuasion, I bought this TV, specifically depending on the reviews on Amazon. The delivery was sooner than promised, and the delivery personnel were very careful and diligent with the delivery. They unpacked the TV to ensure that the product reached me undamaged. The only disappointing aspect was that the Installation team from KEVIN never called. But that turned out to be for the best since I fixed the stand of the TV myself with a screwdriver and then instead of wall-mounting it, I set it up on the TV table. Now let me tell you about the features. Picture Quality is Outright excellent. Compared to similar 24 inch TVs offered by LG, Samsung and Sony, which I observed in stores and my friends' homes, KEVIN has an impeccable picture quality. Color quality is well-managed and the brightness is just right. TV's body is firm and the TV's screen has no wear or ageing despite extreme use for months. The best thing of this TV- the SOUND BAR. You don't need an external sound unit or home theatre system because the SOUND BAR has incredible sound quality which is still clear everywhere, even in a 2000 sq ft house. All in all, don't doubt this TV. Just go for it. You won't get a 24 inch TV with such incredible quality from any other brand for such good price. Let me say that again- ""GO FOR IT!""",Surprisingly Excellent!!!!,B079ZSFJRG
"Nice product...Picture Quality is good. Sound is very nice loud and clear...very light weight... I've also kevin 40"" smart LED....my experience with Kevin is awesome...",Nice Product in this price range,B079ZSFJRG
Waste of money and time.. Screen became loose and interior parts are visible in display. Produt is defective and even no replacement available since it is out of stock now.. Worst purchase ever.. Amazon not verifying the profuct quality and it fails.. In the name. Of offer they are pushing the very defective product. Please don't purchase and suffer,Please don't buy..!,B079ZSFJRG

"Review after using it 2 days: Purchased this TV on Amazon Summer Sale at a price of 6299(with card discount). At such a low price point, this is Incredible. Unable to believe that LED TV's are so cheap right now. For those, who are complaining that the display looks reddish, need to decrease the Saturation level, It'll be fine after that. Play with Brightness, Contrast, saturation and sharpness to get the perfect Image You're looking for. My suggestion is to keep Brightness -45, contrast- 40,saturation-25, sharpness-30. Let me give it's Pros and Cons Pros: 1. Good Packaging. 2. Ultra fast Delivery(Thanks to Amazon) 3. Display looks Great 4. Excellent Audio. 5. Dirt Cheap 6. 2 HDMI and USB ports. 7. Aux/ 5.1 Channel Home theater supported. 8. Installation Done within 24 hours. Cons: 1. Display is not Factory Calibrated, You need to Adjust the display(Brightness/Contrast/Saturation/Sharpness). 2. Remote is not very clicky and Batteries are not provided with remote.(I had to rush to the nearest store for the battery while installing the TV) Manufacturers need to provide that. 3. IR sensor of the remote is weak, You need to point the remote to the TV then it'll work, It does not work in case IR sensor is facing any other direction. 4. Volume is not much effective after 50, There is a Huge different between 30 and 50 but there is minor differences between 50 and 100.(Almost No change between 50-75) 5. CS team of Kevin don't looks professional, they don't even have basics CS Skills. This is a pretty new item and those are my Initial Observations. In case i notice something else, I'll update it here. Hope you found this review a helpful one, Have a nice day!",Good Budget TV,B079ZSFJRG
there is noting to say about tv because its everything is fine. dodnt jurge it by its price realy a nice tv,fabuluse,B079ZSFJRG
"A genuine review. This tv is really nice. Picture quality really really good. Bright colours, clear picture, etc Sound is very loud and audio quality is good. 5 types sound adjustments so set as per our needs. At 40 % sound is also very loud. Clear crisp quality. Keep suround sound option off for best results. I feel display is ips i mean made of plactic type which is durable. My child taps hands many times on the tv screen and i feel the screen is durable and strong. As the name says yes the display is led. 2 hdmi 2 usb works perfectly. Tried google chromecast works with an ease. Usb port dectection is fast and easy. Usb data transfer is easy when 2 usb storage device connected . Have tried and worked perfectly. No manual needed. Little common sense and all setup is easy. Side buttons also durable. Tv really light weight. Even a small kid can lift is like a toy. Best part is tv made in india than also i assure the quality of this product is really really worth and good. One can opt to buy the tv without thought.",Wonderful product.,B079ZSFJRG

"After 3months usage Easily carrying,very light weight,HD QUALITY,Good Contrast Great picture Quality(use HDMI cable with Hd set-up box) and Sound bar is Amazingly Dolby Home theatre like sound experience, very loud sound,Pendrive support- Pictures,movies (mkv format also) ,Freeze option is Good,Can be connected to Pc also Ports:-2USB,2HDMI, VGA, Headphone jack,video game ports Technician who fitted my TV said this TV is much better than Mi TV 4c pro Delayed installation and average quality service. But Customer service from company side are better than I expected. Verdict:- Inspite of going for Android TV 32inch with 2gb ram better go for KEVIN and buy Chromecast/Firestick/JioGigafiber becoz an android TV costs additional 8k-9k extra with less usable features",Upgrade your CRT TV with Kevin,B079ZSFJRG
This is called perfection of sound and picture quality at very reasonable price. After using 3 month I am giving this review that this is the best TV at this price you will never get any other in market at less price with best quality also.,Its perfect TV..,B079ZSFJRG
1. It's look nice & stylish due to bottom speaker. 2. Sound quality also decent compared to others brand. 3. Picture quality avarage. At last we can say that it's not a bad deal if we look on the price and warrenty. In Dewali offer on 2018 I got this only ₹4990 and 2 years warrenty. Thank you.,Good Quality According To The Price Point,B079ZSFJRG
Value for money product . Picture quality and sound is good. However there is a constant thumping sound when external speakers are connected. Solved the problem by directly connecting the external speakers to set top box. TV is working fine till date.,Performance meets price,B079ZSFJRG
"Overall a good basic TV to view HD channels.Good picture clarity and sound clarity. Normal channels also appear good but recommend to use hd connection to view channels in high clarity. Value for money . 1) Value for money 2) Speaker quality is good. 3) Picture quality is great. 4) Standard build quality. 5) Best connectivity. 6) Easy to handle. 7) Don't know why people goes for Sony, Samsung or LG with more cost. I agree the fact that there's no other TV better than this one in this price range. Don't think, go for it.",Great television with nice sound and clarity ...,B079ZSFJRG
"I got this TV at an unbelievable price. This product is definitely worth the money. It might not be comparable to Sony, Samsung not LG but the kind of money they charge is definitely not worth the extra quality they offer. The only complaint is that no one came to install the TV but all necessary pieces to mount the TV on wall are in the box, it took me a total of 20 minutes to mount the TV on my own. If you are looking for a quality product and you are not part of the top 100 richest list then a good buy.",A quality product,B079ZSFJRG
So I am writing this review after using the TV for 3months. The sound of the tv has gone off and I have been calling the customer service of Kevin For last 5days and they have not been able to arrange a technician to check my TV. Really bad. Have put up a complain on consumer forum too as the call centre representatives just keep saying technical issue can't check details or dey keep apologizing for no technician availability.... Disgusting....,Pathetic,B079ZSFJRG
I am using past 3 months. The HD picture quality is awesome and sound also super. I recommend to purchase this TV Under 8k.,Fantastic LED TV,B079ZSFJRG
"Kevin has made definitely a good product. There are 2 32 inch HD tvs available from Kevin on Amazon. One is at 8490 and other is at 9490. Looks to be both are same variants. So if you buy 8490 TV in the same you can get it for 7000-8000 after discounts. 32inch TV under 8000 is really a surprise. I am pleased by the quality of the TV for the price. Pros: very economical, good quality, light weight, sound and picture quality are excellent for the price range. And I received 2 year warranty during the sale. Cons: I don't find any as of now. I received a defective remote, though I had some issues with Amazon, Kevin is very prompt in resolving the issue. They have replaced the remote with in 4 days.",Affordable 32 inch led TV from Kevin/beston,B079ZSFJRG

"Don't expect too much while your keeping so less price. For this price, the product is more than suitable. Got it and used for 5 months and reviewing. Till now no issue.

"Picture quality and sound are better than many top brands. And I purchased in just 6300 with 10% HDFC Discount whereas many top brands are of 14k and more for 32""",Tremendous Purchase,B079ZSFJRG
"Its okay for the price paid, I missed buying this repeatedly when the price and exchange offers and card discounts were the best in the first Amazon Festival Sale. Finally bought it for 5490/- under exchange for old 21"" CRT TV. Picture and sound is okay and I bought Sennheiser HD 206 headphones to use with this TV but I find the sound quite low and really have to up the volume in both the set-top box remote and the TV remote. Might be a problem with the Sennheiser headphone though. Have played movies through USB flash drive (MKV/AVI formats) and they play okay. Now am using it mainly for standard definition cable through Hathway set-top box. Made in India so looking forward to good service for supporting national effort.",Made in India,B079ZSFJRG

"As usual it was fantastic delivery by Amazon !! In time as promised. Thanks Amazon for keeping their reputation. I was surprised by customer support of Kevin. After receipt of TV and asking for installation, TV was installed within 2 hours !!! Support engineers are so enthusiastic and knowledgeable for installation and presentation of TV. We at our family were very brand cautious. I purchased TV after reading reviews, specifications on Amazon. I can say the product is superb. I am using it for 15 days now and connected to dish TV. The picture quality, sound was really good. The best I liked is the viewing angle. We at our family can view TV from any angle with the same quality. Thanks Kevin for such a wonderful product. I hope the product will work for at least 2-3 years without any problems. My suggestion is just go for it and purchase. You will never regret your decision.",Superb TV !!,B079ZSFJRG
"The TV was bought just a month back. so far its performance seems to be satisfactory, as I did not get any complains. Installation was prompt. However, the fixture provided for wall mounting did not seem to be sturdy and therefore some additional amount had to be spent for stable mounting. This was done satisfactorily by the same person who came for the installation.",It was a gift,B079ZSFJRG

"I was very circumspect while ordering the tv . But it has more than met my expectations. It is very light weight. Couldn't understand the wall mount accessory, however. Sounds ok, too. Best thing is the picture quality. Maybe due to the size. Thinking of getting one more 55 inch . Suggestions to buyers. Wall mount it. As it is very light weight chances of it tumbling over even with a strong gust of wind.",Quality made affordable,B079ZSFJRG
"Now that I have been using the TV for about a month, I should say that picture quality is excellent; sound is clear and crisp though total volume level is a bit on the lower side.

"Bought this TV for my parents' bedroom about 3 months back and they are very happy about it. Has good connectivity options, including USB ports to power a fire stick or roku easily and plays media from usb without issues. Personally I find the picture sound quality to be very good for the price and overall value for money. The picture looked very bright and contrast as the upgrade was from a old CRT tv but the inbuilit picture modes were a quick relief.

"Worth your every penny. I was searching for tv within 6k budget. After doing a lot of research on the internet and online portal. I finally ordered Kevin. The only con which I felt about this brand is Kevin customer care. When I try to reach their toll-free number for installation IVR always says the same line already our representative is busy. And automated music plays in bg. After several attempts, I tried to open the product and installed by myself as my requirement was not to wall mount. So just want to put the tv in my stand.

So far so happy with this experience. It was smooth and painless. TV is very good in it's price. However, comparing this TV with other brands such as Sony or LG doesn't make any sense to me.

"Product got delivered on 7th Nov which was diwali, next day when I called their helpline was closed so I opened the bix myself. Unexpectedly great picture quality, loud sound and good colours. I got this for 6800 in sale and I cannot be happier although I bought this as Stop gap product since my old TV broke and I had to buy another on the spot so chose the lowest option due to budget issues but looks likeI I am going to keep it longer. I also purchased Nobil Skido for someone from flipkart last year which costed around 7500 and had Bluetooth connectivity option for audio but picture quality on this one is better the only question is how long will it last. :)",You get more than what you pay for,B079ZSFJRG

Using from past 2 months and I am satisfied with the quality. Durability I dont know about the product but quality is good . I got this tb in aprox 6600 price range,Good TV,B079ZSFJRG
"Top quality TVs (Sony, Samsung, LG) are about 2.5-3 times the price... cheap TV (but reputed names.. like MI, Micromax) are abt 2 times this price - this is so low price (other similar priced TVs were of unknown brands.. Kevin has made some name/presence by now), I was pretty sure it was a cheap quality dud! I thought if this TV lasted the warranty period, then its still value for money,... so i took the risk. TV arrived.. it stopped working on the same day!!!!!! inspection+replacement request registered with amazon.. smooth experience there, finally replaced.. and the new TV works perfectly. Note - the installation+warranty time servicing+repairs etc.. has been outsourced by Kevin to a third party company called Jeeves.. they're all digital, with all communications and visits etc recorded via sms-es, emails, etc... very professional. So, if tv ever gets spoilt, the toll-free experience+service/repair experience should be trouble-free. Also Note - There is an extended warranty provided at the time of purchase - for such a cheap tv, if I had 1 yr of extra warranty, then why not? But fr some reason I could not purchase the extended warranty. But at the time of installation, the Jeeves technician offered me extended warranty from them - so, i bought - 2 yrs for 1100Rs. Am glad I couldn't buy extended warranty at time of checkout.. and since Jeeves is the main entity handling repairs etc, it was better to buy from them... So now my cheap TV has a 1+2=3yr warranty! Nice!!! TV - picture quality - OK.. does the job pretty well, the 15k-20k+Rs TV will be better.. but I don't care, at this price. The non-HD channels have slightly pixellated edges, but I noticed that if I reduced the sharpness to 0, the problem goes away. Everything else is all good - only thing is the ""whites"" seems a bit over-exposed/too bright, and if you reduce the brightness and contrast so that pure white ares of the picture looks alright, then the dark/shadowy/black areas of the picture appear too dark... you have to strike a balance(best settings worked for me at - Brightness-55, Contrast-35, Sharpness-0, Colour/Saturation-35... good balance of reducing overexposed whites and maximising dark-zone clarity), but trust me.. at this price, this is nothing, and you would have a good viewing experience. All other features - eco mode, sound, build quality etc is pretty decent.. no complaints there. Final verdict - Go for it! super low price, pretty good viewing experience.. total value for money.. definitely go for it if your priority is getting max for your money.. if priority is quality, go for samsung, lg etc. Also, I'd suggest - skip the extended warranty and buy the same at installation time from the Jeeves technician - he may not offer it to you on his own, so ask for it.",Mind blowing price and value-for money!,B079ZSFJRG
I ordered this as a gift i was really worried how it will be but it was really good with the price range which i got and so happy with the product the only problem i see the picture quality which looking average on normal DTH box probably u need to use HD box but overall it was really good.. I think anyone can buy this without any doubt and the installation was very fast and he was polite and explained everything.. Overall Satisfied,good TV under 10k,B079ZSFJRG

"I must tell you that being unable to afford a good TV is no longer an issue if you are going for this Kevin product along with Amazon Fire Stick. Just the TV alone with a cable connection might become boring. I suggest you to buy the fire stick too as it is the most priceless purchase you can do. The TV as such has 1 ""cons"": The 'face' of people you see on TV will appear red and all objects pink or deep orange will also appear red. Why am I still giving it 5 stars: It is ideal for Bedrooms and small halls. The sound system is just okay to satisfy your basic need The fire stick enables it to cast any app and for display mirroring from your phone too! So, therefore if you want to buy the cheapest smart TV but can't afford it, go for this combination as it comes cheaper. Another reason why I chose it was because 32 inch TVs hurt the eye if you're room is small and I also had space constraints as most of the walls either had a bed/cupboard/almirah covering it. I've paid 4999 for the TV and 3199 for the fire stick in the 2019 freedom sale Thanks for the amazing product Kevin, just improve the redness issue and there is nothing to stop this TV from becoming the most sold in this price range where millions who can't afford come.",Paisa Vasool!,B079ZSFJRG

Trust me Kevin is selling on lesser prices then prices are available in wholesale market like Lajpat Rai market, Karol Bagh Market and Panchkuian Road Market in Delhi. I bought 3 tvs from Adsun. 2 are repaired by them three times but still are out of order but still in warranty. The Adsun is not doing the needful.

"Cheap product..Cheap quality..buy at your own risk Defective product received. Screen had a black dot at the bottom of the screen a hardware fault which was confirmed by the install guy and later Amazon service guy. Amazon will not give you a refund if the product is defective and will force you to get the TV replaced. Didn't want to get a replacement as lost faith in the brand the first time, but Amazon forced replacement You have to call the brand..the brand will NOT call you..you will have to persistently call the brand for installation as their phone does not work always..seems that the brand is not interested in after sales service too hope that one year warranty will be provided and they will attend to calls. Please buy the TV at your own risk. If you can better spend some more money and go for a reputed brand and not this. Still did not want to go for a replacement but Amazon is forcing for a replacement and not issuing a refund. Amazon services have to gone bad they just say that you are a valuable customer and then tell you that they are sorry and cannot help, which will help them lose more customers. Again read all critical reviews before buying this Brand which are cheap Chinese assembled TVs with crappy panels. Would have been happy if Amazon had given me a refund but now NOT happy with Amazon. I am sure that Amazon will not publish this review, as they review reviews before publishing them.",Defective Screen..Cheap quality..buy at your own risk,B079ZSFJRG

Picture Quality and sound both are good. We can prefer this product as this is economically cheap and provide you all features compare to others. But most important is its poor service.

"This TV is completely worthless. I purchase this as an additional TV after reading good reviews and 4.5 rating on Amazon. I can categorise problems in this TV. 1. Panel fitting is not upto mark (Screen seems Loose) 2. Tv Screen bleeds Red Red and RED. (You barely feel any other color) No matter what running on this tv, either you play movie through USB or DTH. 4. No customer care support. Kevin didn't call me for installation, I have to call repeatedly and finally call connected. The person on phone said ""ENGINEER WILL CALL YOU WHEN HE HAS TIME"" till now no one called me. 5. Kevin people don't even provide the Batteries for remote. 6. Wall mount provided with the TV is so weak, I doubt if they hold that TV properly. If Kevin people see this, plz send your engineer and try to solve these problems otherwise I have to return this.",Worthless Product with no installation support and RED bleeding Screen,B079ZSFJRG

"Display and Sound r 2 imp aspects of any TV. Putting this review after 5 days of use. This TV has got poor quality display, I m using SD settop box. The closeup image is average view but any distant display is just pathetic. I can see a shape of the display/ image item but cant see the details, like can not recognize the face or eyes etc. Text at bottom of screen while watching news or any channel is pixelated, rough edged text. Even after adjusting display settings,Colors are so bright that r ready to Burn ur eyes. Red is too red, blue is too blue and so on. Overall its a below average viewing experience. Smoothness of displayed objects is completely missing. Sound is loud and Clear, no issues with it. I will not recommend this 32 inch non smart TV just simply coz it lacks very much on viewing, and one need to seriously compromise with his/her viewing experience",Bad experience and below average product,B079ZSFJRG
