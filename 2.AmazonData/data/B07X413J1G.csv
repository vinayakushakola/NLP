"Simply Value for Money !!! without any doubts…… Best thing is that it covers everything like Netflix and Prime video also other apps too. Can refer the photo. It looks very slim as it is Bezel Less with good brightness, sound quality also good. Voice search works fine. Remote good. Video runs smoothly also when casting from cell. As May be I am the 1st buyer of this product so I was trying to find the defect since 4 days but till now was not able to find any. Product won against me. This is also my 1st review for any product on any website so do not know if above can help others but please ask question I will try to answer.",Simply Value for Money !!! without any doubts……,B07X413J1G
"For reference, in my living room I'm using a LG 55"" 1080p oled screen with nvidia shield tv and JBL LSR 308 MK2 studio monitors for sound. Using Sanyo in the bedroom with a yamaha YAS 108 soundbar connected with an optical cable. tl;dr: You get what you pay for. It's a good IPS panel which needs some tuning. The android tv experience is awful, you may get an aftermarket device like nvidia shield tv. Discerning videophiles stay away, this is a good inexpensive second tv if you need one but definitely not the one for your living room. Pros: - Above average IPS panel. Has some vignetting around corners and contrast isn't all that great because this' an IPS panel, but viewing angle is nice and wide. For the cost, a great panel is all I wanted. - The noise reduction and motion handling seem alright so far, except for 4k@60Hz. - Good external design - Acceptable sound. - Android TV Cons: - The software (Android TV implementation) is a huge mess. I've been using nvidia shield tv for 4 years now and the lack of attention to details on this 'smart' TV shows. - To begin with, the specs to run the Android TV aren't great, so the interface lags badly. Also because of the lower amount of RAM, every time you launch an app e.g. Netflix, it starts with the login process every effing time. - The google assistant is a hit and miss, because of the slower system. - The specs on this TV can't handle a youtube video 4k@60fps. The debug mode shows a lot of dropped frames which leads to jerky videos. 4k@24fps seems alright. - Only 5 color profile modes i.e. Standard, Vivid, Sport, Game and User. No Movie mode calibration. The user mode can be tuned to your liking with some basic options, no advanced color calibration options available. - THIS IS WHAT I HATE THE MOST: The option to tune picture and other TV options isn't available in the main menu or by pressing menu on the remote when you're in android tv screen. You have to press source and select some source option, now the menu will bring up 'more settings' where you may tune the picture settings. Sanyo, you have such a huge remote where most of the buttons are absolutely useless, would it have killed you put in a dedicated button to bring up the advanced menu? - Some picture settings apply only to the video, e.g. the color temperature. The android TV menu and even the subtitles aren't affect by these settings. E.g. If you select warm gamma, the subtitles and the android main screen still appear with a blue hue. - Amazon prime isn't available as an android tv app (although it's available on shield tv). Casting amazon prime onto this panel isn't a very pleasant experience. It doesn't play most of the times.","Great as bedroom TV, not for the living room",B07X413J1G
"Pros: Good picture quality, Latest Android, full screen Bezel less, good preinstalled apps, builtin Chromecast and budget price. Cons: Audio isn't very good, 1 star energy rating.",Good TV overall,B07X413J1G
Bought this TV to replace another 4K tv. REally happy about the purchase Pros Alround good picture and voice quality. Very crisp HD tv channels render. Sports channels are fluid. Android installation was breeze. Android 9 recognizes mobile phone (or vice versa) and all you have to say is - Okay google set up my TV. Wifi installation was quick and and the first thing to happen was TV app updated to latest one. This TV is slim and appears smaller compared to another brand I had earlier. Customer care called a twice to se if the TV was installed and everything was okay Overall very happy with the product. Lastly this is a Panasonic brand which I knew after the customer care called.,Really good TV,B07X413J1G
No Amazon prime video app Pls provide app,Good but no prime video,B07X413J1G
"Awesome product in the price range...Picture quality, sound quality both are awesome...Voice search works fine....Latest android available...However not able to download few apps from Google store....Was trying to search airtel tv.... may be it has some restriction...Also didn't see google chrome option and not able to download the same. Overall nice tv which has all basic needs.",Nice tv,B07X413J1G
I did not like the product and I want to return for my refund please help me in getting a refund for the purchase,I want a refund,B07X413J1G
"So all in all good product, the sound seems a little bit off. picture quality is as best as it is available in the market Don't be fooled if this is your first android tv , yes it does ships with google play store but don't be under the impression of getting tons of application to play around with. You will be left with limited apps, out of that also very less would be actually useful tip:- still haven't used or tested Netflix (but the separate button is given for the same) if you are buying this for family recommended is amazon prime rather than Netflix which will be only English while prime is much cheaper giving most of the local language movies and shows pros:- 1)screen (4K HDR) 2)lightweight 3)wireless life 4)low on budget 5)inbuilt chrome cast(which means you will be able to cast everything from your android mobile device as long as you are connected on the same wifi network-->tried amazon prime works like butter) cons:- 1)sound quality 2)amazon prime missing update after using it for 15-20 days pros:- 1)can watch downloaded movies by plugging Pendrive(saw 10 GB print of avatar -->real treat for the eyes) 2)limited apps to play around with when using it over the internet like hotstar , prime,zee5,jio movies,NetFlix(there is no jio tv ) 3)can play small games like hungry shark or some car games (but big no no for graphics games like pubg) cons:- 1)sound quality goes off the cart when watching some standup comedy on youtube defn it needs some major upgrades 2)side loading of apps is next to impossible (even in spite of it being an android tv){meaing you cant download an app into Pendrive and install it)",Prime is missing(don't know about the dates for OTA update),B07X413J1G
Great customer service from Amazon. My first delivered product was found to be defective and was promptly replaced by Amazon after technical visit. This product is value for money. Great picture 4k. Viewing the same in HD is giving totally different experience. Sound quality is also great. DTS tru surround sound with 20W output is enough to give great sound experience. You can also attach your home theatre to it to get Dolby sound experience. 2 USB and 3 HDMI slots. Will recommend everyone to buy this.,Great product at great price with amazing picture and sound quality,B07X413J1G
"I got this TV on 22nd of this month. So far very good. Picture quality and sound quality is amazing. Integration with Netflix, amazon prime and YouTube is flawless. Google voice support is very good. Internal chrome cast works like a charm. Only flaw is Google photos app missing from the tv, we need to cast from phone to see photos. Overall expextioanlly good for this price range. Quick and clean delivery from Amazon. And Engineer from Panasonic team came on the same day and did the walmount and explained all features of TV.",Awesome smart TV for less than 15k range,B07X413J1G

"I wanted to connect my Anazon 4K firestick however, I have realized that it does not support HDCP 2.2 which is mandatory to play 4k content from external devices. HDCP 2.2 is there from the last 10 years or so and they did not include in it. You can't play Blu-ray movies or 4k movies on USB/Hard drive without HDCP 2.2 and its not upgradable either. Waste of money will return it.",DOES NOT SUPPORT HDCP 2.2 FOR 4K Content DO NOT BUY!,B07X413J1G
"So i ordered sanyo smart tv. It works so smoothly, like there is no lag while switching apps or anything. Nice sound and picture quality. Easy to use. Best part i got this tv in 2 days. Installation was done the same day. Everything was hassle free. Anybody who’s looking for a nice smart tv in a affordable budget should surely go for this one",Amazing deal for 13k,B07X413J1G
"This Smart LED TV running on Android is an excellent general purpose TV. Installation and wall mounting was done smoothly by service engineer sent by Panasonic / Sanyo. Most popular OTTs come preloaded as apps - Prime Video, Netflix, Sony Liv, Hotstar, Zee5. YouTube is available as well. We are using mobile hotspot for feeding internet, it works fine without any glitches. Haven't used the TV as a web browser so not sure whether that can be done. Picture quality and viewing angles are good for the price level. Sound quality and clarity should have been better. There is digital audio out available so external speakers can be used. Overall, except for the average sound quality, an excellent deal in 13,000 Rs!",Great value for money!,B07X413J1G

SPECTACULAR... This is all I can probably define its quality by.. awesome picture quality assisted with great customer service and the price is amazing... Made with Japanese technology... Must Buy.. you ll forget Sony or Samsung the other brand... Chinese brands don't even stand against it,GO FOR IT,B07X413J1G
"Bought this one with high expectations, unfortunately it didn't work. First of all the HDR badge of this tv is a gimmick I guess. It doesn't play HDR for YouTube only 4K. Voice search in YouTube doesn't work. Amazon prime is unavailable so HDR playability of that is also questionable. videos from usb doesn't play in HDR. Sound out put through HDMI provides only stereo output no 5.1 channel. And the worst thing with my unit is screen bleeding. It's horrible. Raised a request for replacement but haven't got any confirmation. Even the energy star sticker was also missing. Now I feel like going for Mi or Motorola tv would had been a good choice. The only plus is normal 4k content looks good specially with thin bezels it gives a cinematic experience. So think twice before going for this.",Don't keep your expectations high,B07X413J1G

Delivered on 02 oct. The panasonic guy came on the same day and was reasonably okay. The tv seems okay. Can give an honest feedback only a fter i use it for a couple of months. But the immediate pronlem is is that prime videos is not working on this t.v. Amazon customer care has informed me that it is a software issue and they will try to sort this out in 24 hours. Lers hope it starts working after they resolve the isuue. Will keep postong updates.,Device not getting registering on Amazon Prime videos.,B07X413J1G
Great sound quality. Is is amazing to watch hd channels with 5.1 experience,Better than expected,B07X413J1G
"UPDATE 4-Nov The Sanyo customer service engineers worked with me to resolve the issue. The Prime Video account now stays connected. Super CS team. Thanks Ashish ----------- I bought this TV during the sale and the transaction, delivery and installation was VERY smooth. One reason I bought this TV was for Prime Video. The TV comes with a built in app but that app fails to stay logged in. Every time one has to sign in and verify account using keyboard on TV remote. This happens every single day. After spending a few hours with Amazon tech support I am told that this TV and a bunch of others like Mi and Vu are 'presently' not compatible. The issue has been escalated and the app will be fixed. But there is no fixed timeline. So till then login Everytime.",Works very well Great Customer Service,B07X413J1G
"I chose this over MI TV and Motorola Tv. There are few glaring issues: 1. The screen works fine when movie is playing (see pics, one black n white movie and one colour movie) , but when we operate menu or in some display screen, the screen is very uneven. I have attached 4 pics, you can see the uneveness. I am not sure if this is defective, or this is how it is supposed to work. But, while playing movies, it has no issues. May be backlight issue? 2. Installation I had no issues. But wall mount is pretty basic, but it is going to be very difficult to remove once placed. Very bad quality wall mount 3. Sound is loud. I like it, I hardly go above 25% and it is enough for my room. Better than MI TV 4. I don't use the inbuilt Netflix and prime. I have prime stick, and I use it. No issues so far For given the price, it's good. But if given a choice again, I would have chose MI TV, which was around 1k cheaper. Also this unevenness during display irritating me. I don't know if it is a defect or not. Pls coment below with your views",Not sure if to return or keep it,B07X413J1G
"I m very happy with this product. Screen quality is awesome. Audio is very good. Viewing angles are great. I connected it with my Portable HDD. It is working flawlessly without any lag. It has one usb 3.0 jack and another one normal. I tried connecting Bluetooth headphone with it and it works nice too. Android experience is great. I connected it with dth thru HDMI port(total-3) and it's working superb and also connected it to my PC and tried playing games and again superb results when you see the gameplay in 4k but my rig was like ""I was bought for a 1080p monitor"" need to upgrade graphics card. Very happy with my purchase and believe me this is a great TV and you can trust this Japanese brand without any second thought. Amazon delivered it very next day. They only raised a call with the company to install it and within 48 hrs Panasonic dealer came with his mechanic and they mounted it. No problem at all. Very happy with Amazon and Sanyo(Panasonic) service.",Sanyo is the best.,B07X413J1G

"The TV is advertised as being able to play Amazon prime video. In fact the picture of the product has a prime video app shown prominently. Surprisingly I tried to login to prime video first thing today when I got the TV and was unable to login after repeated attempts. Talking to prime video support I was informed that sanyo is not authorized to stream prime video content and so I cannot watch prime video content on this TV, although I have a prime subscription. Update: i got a call from sanyo rep who walked me through registering for prime video, and after doing a reset prime seems to be working for me now (registration needs to be done on a desktop browser rather than mobile).",Prime works after help from support,B07X413J1G
Pros: TV Looks good Picture quality is awesome 3 HDMI Ports is a plus YouTube Streaming is very smooth and seamless. Sound quality is decent enough. Cons: So far None. Will add more details after 2-3 months of usage. Adding more details after 1month usage: 1. More booting time🕒 2. No bass but sound is clear enough.,Good Deal for the Price,B07X413J1G
"TV got delivered and installed in time. The person could not complete demonstration due to power failure. Thereafter again and again I am trying for their support but there is no response. The person came for installation is disconnecting my calls....... Before purchasing and installing I was been told over phone that this TV model supports prime video. Also one of the customer's review says so, for which the customer has uploaded the screenshot with prime video icon. For two three days I tried my best to install this app, but couldn't do.

Almost a week since we got this TV..Got it at a very good price with exchange...

If you are planning to get your first smart TV ..go gor it..,Excellent product at the price range,B07X413J1G
"I have been using the 32 inch model TV for about 3 days now. Very happy so far.... This tv is available for 11.5k plus an additional 10pct discount on credit cards. Great bang for the buck! Pros #Android tv...so there's a whole world of apps, you tube movies, games etc that you can install. Also to play movies from your home library (by connecting hard drive or pen drive into USB port), you can install VLC media player app which is better than the default movie player app that comes pre-installed. VLC plays almost any movie format and will also display subtitles properly. #Great LED panel with good viewing angles, decent contrast and brightness. The IPS panel is almost 80% as good as a Samsung....don't expect the same quality as this is a budget tv. #Digital audio out (optical) in addition to the HDMI return port so that you can connect your home theatre system. #remote and menu is very easy to operate, being android OS #very thin bezels... Looks sleek Cons #Only 1 year warranty on the panel #Speaker sound is very tinny... It's ok for general purposes, bit if you want to enjoy a movie it will be good to buy a standalone music system which will do a better job than a TV speaker regardless of which brand you buy. TV speakers have a tiny form factor so that constraints the performance. #slight delay while switching between apps... Which is not a big deal really... This is not a phone after all # there is cheap plastic cladding around the bezels... High end TVs have metal which looks more classy # even though the Amazon prime app is installed, you cannot use it to play videos... Amazon for some reason doesn't register the tv as a device. I think Amazon wants people to pay an extra 3k for their fire stick. But there is an easy work around... Since the tv comes with built-in Chromecast, you can cast any thing on the phone to the TV (provided you have an Android phone and there's a home WiFi connection that both your tv and phone can connect to). So open up prime video on the phone and simply cast it to your tv.... Works like a charm.",Perfect for the price!,B07X413J1G
"Sorry Sanyo for writing this review after so many days, as i didn't have the word's to express my feelings and views about this Tv. Before buying this Tv i just checked , it's a #japanese Tv, #latest Stock Android and cheaper in its segment compared to its Chinese counter parts. My first impressions is #WTF, i don't know may be i was shifting from CRT Tv ,where you don't find graining as it is common in LCD and lED panels. the best viewing distance for this 32 inch tv is beyond 8 feet or you will see the graining in pictures. Pros :- pricing - cheaper in its segment Features - stock android, cromecast support, ips led, wide range of app support. Os- Latest android OS and Google play store support with all the present day necessary entertainment app support (youtube, Netflix, prime video, sonyliv, voot, zee5 etc). with stock Android you will get limitless possibilities. Remote - A combination of old and modern type, so its easy to understand for every age group like your parents and grand parents. build quality is also good. Free wall mount - free wall mounting kit is available in the box not like chinese counter parts(Mi, tcl, iffalcon etc) where you have to pay extra 400- 500 more for it. Picture Quality- not great but 4.5 out of 5 as its a budget Tv and its competitors have little bit of poor quality than it, which i can bet. it can be enjoyed in HD channels and HD contents, else it is crap in SD connection so, don't blame Sanyo for your connection type. i got a new Airtel HD connection but somtimes that setup box transmit so bad colors that its looks completely crap apart drom that all online content like youtube, netflix etc have good color Quality. Brand Value - if you can think to buy cheap chinese crap like (Mi, Tcl, iffalcon etc) which have a experience of only 5- 6 years and doesn't manufacture panels just assemble the tv buying panel from Lg, Sony, Samsung and panasonic then you shouldn't hesitate to buy Sanyo as it is a #72 years old Japanese brand not only that its is backed by two companies as Sanyo got incorporated to Panasonic(101 year old) in 2009 and these companies are panel manufacturers and not only Tv assemblers like Chinese brands. so you are buying a Tv from a brand which has 173 years of experince in Tv manufacturing in total. Audio - Audio quality is good but Bluetooth audio is not that loud, if you connect your bluetooth speakers then make sure your Bluetooth speakers output is more that TV speakers i.e 20 watts. Service - i din't use their service as it's a 20 day old TV but from their installation service i can say that the after sales service is great, as i didn't called them for installation which is free, they called me from their end within 24 hrs of delivery and technician visited my house with in 12 hrs of that call, mounted my Tv , described its functionality, has a very polite behavior and Didn't even ask for #Tips like others do Airtel guy asked for extra #Tip after Installation. Not only that Panasonic guys called me @ times more to install the same Tv. from this i can say their after sells service will be great. Cons - Only two 1 - Picture quality is little bit of whitish and i believe all its chinese counterparts have worse than it not #Mototrola. but Motorola is costlier than Sanyo by 2000 usually and 4000 during Amazon great Indian sale. 2 - bezel less display - actually its not bezel less completely as the panel have 1/2 inch of border all around it you can see it in the picture where Sanyo could have added a frame covering the panel rather than leaving it just like that and saying it bezel less display as it is dangerous to small accident or little water splash as it can go easily inside the panel damaging the whole panel. if Sanyo you are reading it then please add a outer casing to protect the panel edges rather than leaving it just like that and saying it bezel less. And at-last its a great value for money even though Oneplus tv which costs some much didn't have #Netflix support in its Tv but this budget Tv has all in it. so, don't be fool buying chinese crap (Mi, tcl, iffalcon etc) just go for this Solid Japanese Built Sanyo Kaizen series andriod smart tv without any hesitation. with larger screen size you will get more features. i know nobody is going to read that much big review as i also didn't buy this Tv reading reviews but i youtubed it and luckily found one video about this TV which is great enough to convince me to buy this TV as the youtube is completely biased with chinese cheap crap TV's review. So, i am going to make a youtube review video very soon and i will update its link in this review.",The Best Budget Android Tv of 2019,B07X413J1G
"Superb smart tv, with good picture and sound quality for the price. Earlier I had some issues with registration on prime video, but I contacted the Amazon customer care they told me to factory reset the TV and then try to register, and now it is working fine. Sound requires some personal setting to tune it perfectly and picture quality is best in standard settings. All in all it is a good deal.",Excellent deal,B07X413J1G

The TV is excellent value for money. The inbuilt chromecast does a wonderful job. WiFi streaming is absolutely flawless. The 4gb memory is more than enough for your TV apps from the play store.

"I have bought the 43 inch 4k variant 1. The picture quality is quite impressive and deliveres 4k HDR as promised at 60 fps. 2. This is only TV in this price range with IPS display with high viewing angle. This pretty much sealed the deal for me. 3. The sound is loud and clear.Its pretty loud even at low volumes. I wouldn't say it the best sound but you always buy an soundbar to go with your TV. 4. Since it runs android pie its clean and has google play store to install many apps and games. Just a pair a bluetooth joystick an you can play games on big screen. The OS is little buggy though, it didn't recognise my wifi at first and had some initial trouble in connecting my phone. 5. Most of the apps like Netflix, Youtube and Hotstar are available except for Amazon Prime but thanks to built-in chromecast you can stream it from your mobile swiftly. Eagerly waiting for the OTA to provide the Prime video app. 6. The google assistant works ok. Although the microphone could have been better.",Best Smart TV in this price range,B07X413J1G
"Product purchased: Sanyo 43"" Kaizen 4K UHD TV Mode: XT-43A082U Review feedback: I'm one who do not use Set-top box, Cable TV or Satellite dish. I use internet to watch online videos, movies. My review is based on that. Good points: Picture quality, IPS display is good. Tried with 4K resolution video. Looking Beautiful. Youtube, Hotstar works flawlessly. Netflix shutsdown automatically multiple times. Built-in chrome cast works for casting from mobile and cast from Google chrome browser from Windows PC. Voice recognition is also good. Major disappointments are - Pathetic audio quality. Audio is loud but not a quality sound. Sanyo claims Box speaker. I feel it is not designed for good acoustic. Sound response is very flat. - in internet/online mode, not possible to make any TV settings (like setting brightness, contrast, colour, Bass, Treble, etc..) - TV settings are available only for AV mode and HDMI mode. Since i don't have cable TV or Set-top box don't have option to change other than what is factory set. (refer picture attached. Only factory preset video and audio modes are possible to make) - Since TV settings are not possible in online mode - factory set backlight is eye irritating, especially watching during night without lights. Most surprising was : when called Sanyo service helpdesk they provided local service support contact number. And the person who visited home says, that is the TV limitations. And he commented that I should have bought after verifying in showroom. Unfortunately Sanyo is sold only online. :-( Overall, this is not a fault. It is a design overlook by Sanyo. Sanyo would have assumed customers will always use TV connection and less internet users. It may be a simple firmware upgrade Sanyo must do to address this issue.",Sanyo need more attention to details in design,B07X413J1G
"Got delivery on time. The Sanyo 'engineer', with a co-worker, showed up for installation the next day. He struggled to boot the tv on,...and the tv just did not relent! He gave up saying, 'Android tv pehle kabhi install nahin kiya hai. Kal, kisi Android TV wale saathi ko bhejunga!"" (and he left). 'Am keeping my fingers crossed in the hope that 'next day', i.e. tomorrow (Oct 15, 2019), a more competent 'engineer' shows up (although, with my vast experience of working with Android devices; I am 'sure' that the tv is meant to boot up on its own, once the power is switched on, without any help from any engineer. My gut feeling: the tv is defective). The Sanyo (Panasonic) engineer came the next day again, with another engineer colleague. They struggled again, but the tv didn't start working. Eventually, they phoned their 'Trainer', who, after listening to the issues, advised them to install some software first, which he was to send. The next day, the engineer came with the software, installed it, and the tv got 'installed' and started working. I was relieved, but all this was not a happy experience. Performance? Haven't spent much time with the tv yet. The SD channels aren't much good to watch. I guess there is no 'upscaling' mechanism in this tv. The sound is also not to my satisfaction (a bit squeaky), but online purchases carry all these 'risks', plus, I have paid only Rs 25000 for this tv. One thing: the Panasonic/Sanyo team was always instantly responsive!",Preliminary reaction: Don't have high expectations!,B07X413J1G
"Don't buy this TV, Service of SANYO is very bad, Remote control of 32 "" tv Kizen series is not working right from the day of installation.

Wow what an Come back Sanyo... Extra ordinary Tv at this Price range. instead of going for popular brands at far higher price blindly go for this TV and save 10-15k of your money. Awesome display and clear & Loud sound. Smart Features are too good.,Extra oridinary Android tv at this price...,B07X413J1G
I am.a tad disappointed that product did not meet the spefications. Reasons as below 1 * power rating Poor quality wall fixture - just two clamps Sound quality does not compare to DTS quality Lack of support for Prime Video app as per Amazon site. At this price is just about covers the value for decent picture quality and smart features. Panasonic have compromised on this price point so not worth it if you ask me.,Average product and very basic,B07X413J1G

"Sanyo Kaizen tv is the best smart tv available in this price range, the Bezel-less Design its super Bright LED IPS Display and yes it runs on Android 9.0 comes with Bluetooth remote for voice search at google assistant, for watching Amazon Prime you need to install it in your smartphone because due security restriction you can only cast amazon prime from your smart phone directly to app in tv and it works flawlessly. We also get a chrome-cast inbuilt so you get plethora of world class photographs as screensaver, its Just outstanding as i also played android games and used several news watching apps, its the best.",Best Smart TV in budget,B07X413J1G

The picture quality is good but the smart features are very bad. I can't cast my mobile screen through chromecast. It could cast only one or two time then it stopped screen mirroring. I tried with two phones but I couldn't mirror the screen. I can't log in into Amazon Prime Video either. It gives a code and asks you to register your device on Amazon but even after registration through code I can't log in. Better buy a non-smart TV because this TV has very useless smart features. I wish I could return it.,Amazon Prime video and chromecast don't work,B07X413J1G
"Voice recognition is absolutely poor and doesn't work if you pair through a mobile account Long delays in applications opening up and extremely poor UI for navigation Sound quality feels like a 3rd grade TV, even a 12 yr Sony LCD has better sound than this Video quality and refresh rate is pathetic and doesnt feel like a UHD TV. I have previously used a Micromax UHD and a Sony UHD and this is absolutely nonsense TV Very disappointed with Amazon also to list such products and promote them",Defect surfaced within 20 days of purchase,B07X413J1G
"Dissatisfied with the customer service and the TV's internal hardware strength. Pros: - Good picture quality, but it dulls colours in darker shots. - Good and loud sound. - All ports work (3 ports in total) - Good build quality considering the price. Cons: - Installation person didn't understand Android OS that much. If something doesn't works, he would reset the whole TV and start again! - After sale support staff doesn't accept TV's flaws. Instead blames on the router. Also, when proved that it was TV's fault, they tried to misexplain us with wrong technical explanation. We had the technical know-how so could catch their deceit. - Remote has too many buttons for our use, and most of them will stay useless for our normal Android TV or set-top-box TV use. - Port placement is awkward if TV is wall-mounted. - Frame around the screen is of poor quality. Easily damageable. - Voice recognition on the remote is very poor. Have to speak very loudly and even then it doesn't translate properly. There's no visible mic hole on the remote. - 1.5GB RAM is not enough. The TV is slow. Takes almost a minute to start-up. Response time is very slow. - TV's WiFi range is very less. Can only work with same room routers or at high-speed bandwidth. Ours didn't work at 20 Mbps from different room. Had to change router position in same room as TV. - TV doesn't keep apps open after screensaver. RAM not enough. - App loading and internet content loading speed is less. Due to less RAM.","Disappointed with the service, there are better options at this price.",B07X413J1G

Too good smart features ...Best picture quality sound superb 👌,All in one best android tv,B07X413J1G
"If you are looking for a 4k uhd tv at a budget price, this TV is a good choice. It comes with android pie ootb, has netflix preinstalled, sound quality is good, picture quality is also appreciable with a good screen to body ratio. However, there is an however ofcourse.. You have to compromise on the system performance. There is only around 2 gb available for you to install additional apps and with the amount of ram its got, browsing through some apps (e. g. sony liv) is choppy. You dont get amazon prime and its not available on the play store either. You cannot adjust thr TV settings from the home screen for some reason, you can only do it from the screensaver screen which is very odd. But after all is said and done, you must realize that its a smart tv at a budget price and weigh in on its positive aspects.",A decent product.,B07X413J1G
"This is a complete smart TV powered by Android P. Besides a world class, smooth, intuitive Android-based smart TV experience this Sanyo 32"" LED TV has a picture perfect display & amazing sound quality, ideal for the bedroom. The remote is also high class, feels solid and premium in hand and has built-in mic to hear your voice commands for the Google Assistant which is integrated into the ecosystem. Voice input is universal. Works perfectly with YouTube as well and, I am sure with all other voice based apps. Voice input takes away the pain of typing. I would say, its the best Android TV and that too very reasonably priced. It's cheaper than a decent mid-range Android phone. Go for it, without a slight hesitation.",An all inclusive package - can't get better than this 😊,B07X413J1G

This is my second tv from Panasonic and again it didn't dissappointed whether its about picture quality, sound or other smart features. Voice recognition is so simple and smooth. Those who are complaining(except genuine faults) about picture quality or sound quality are those who want to buy panaaonic company in 10k. Those who are unable to login to prime videos then please reset your tv and then try to login as earlier i was also facing same issue but when customer service executive called for feedback she told me to do so and now its working fine.

Superb TV for best price Sanyo TV is nothing but Panasonic all sevice intallation are done by Panasonic only Comming up to Review 1. Voice recoginisation is ultimate what ever I want Google help is poping even to power off also i am using voice reconisation just say power off it shuts down superbly and systematically instead of pressing power button shutting suddenly . 2. Apps installed are very much use full Amazon prime and vodaphone play is not installed but you can do through screen mirroring working superbly no need of dish cable connection ( actually cost saving ) 2. Audio enhancement is so nicely designed i connected my tv with HDMI arc with bluplankt sound bar and fenda T60 WITH bluetooth and sony 5.1 via optical neet and cinematic effect is amazing sometimes feel i am in theatre . 4K is absolutely super clarity picture and TV 4.

Picture quality was quite good. Sound is not great.. But ok.. i brought the full HD variant not the 4k one. Amazon prime while installed needs to be logged in everytime you start the tv. This is quite irritating. Once logged in it works well.. Chrome casting is not that great.. Coming back to picture quality after a few days I began to notice some blue discolouration patches on the screen .. i thought maybe it was some static interference but it persisted after removing the home theatre that was in close proximity to the tv.. so requested for the TV to be taken back..,Amazon prime iSsues and screen issues,B07X413J1G
"Updated review: I got a call from the head of the service centre who promptly turned up in a day to address the issues Wall mount: Though it looks like two tacks and screws, he said it has been tested to bear weight and comes after a stringent quality check. The technician who came for installation was not supposed to discourage its use and sell us a mount. So the amount was refunded. Prime video: Apparently the set up needs to be done from a mobile. So the tv was reset and it was set up again using a mobile. The app also started after being registered through amazon prime on the laptop. The head who came explained and responded to all the questions I had about the tv. I had not expected such a prompt reply for a review as I had not even registered a complaint with the centre. Definitely impressed with the promptness.As of now, all the other features seem great as I have not used it long. And I would not hesitate recommending the purchase of this tv. It is well worth and a great purchase for the price Earlier review for which the problems were addressed : It has been only half a day that I have used this tv. It looks good, picture quality seems good enough, the audio quality is not so great at places as it seems to be blaring when songs play and dialogues are not very clear when playing a movie. Some of the apps like airtel tv and vodafone play are not available. Obviously not all apps that are on googleplay can be installed. The major disappointment was prime video app. I register the device on my computer but then on the tv, the screen still says there is a problem with the account and device registration. I could cast prime video from my phone though. I wish the tv resolves this issue as it proudly declares in the ad that prime video app is available on tv. The next problem was that of the wall mount provided. It looks very flimsy and the technician who came ( apparently they come from service centres which provide support, instead of any sanyo company centre), said the mount will be good enough only for 2 years and the company often provides such cheap mounts. He convinced me to buy a sturdy mount for 1100 rupees. Wish the company does not advertise free wall mount with the tv, when all it is going to provide are two tacks and two screws which do not look capable of holding a 5 kg tv. The TV also seems to respond slowly to the commands and the buttons of the remote. I will know more about its performance as the days go by. As of now, it satisfies my requirement of a smart tv. And it is good enough for the price we paid.","Product good enough for the price, prompt service!",B07X413J1G
"Writing this review after a month's usage. I was a bit skeptical before buying it as Sanyo is not enlisted among some of the other leading brands in television sector in the market. There were about 84 ratings when I first came across this product and now amazed to see it had crossed 1200+. Now coming back to the quality, both picture and sound quality are very good, not sure why some people have mentioned that sound isn't good, I think it is pretty adequate. Picture quality is amazing as well, offcourse don't compare it with the other brands which cost you 50k more than this one but it clearly serves purpose way better than its price. Moreover, it does provision all the smart features seamlessly, I have had no problems accessing any of the apps be it prime vedio, YouTube, Netflix etc. No issues with WiFi connectivity too. Having bought it at about 19k during the big billion sale, I think it's an amazing buy and it really serves its purpose. Next coming to the delivery, it was delivered as promised and also the installation was hassle free. Also, the customer care (Panasonic) is pretty responsive too. Go ahead and get it without a second thought, don't fall into the trap of other brands which are way expensive and not really worth.",Delivers what is promised!,B07X413J1G
"It's a good great TV among the big brands in the market. Picture quality is excellent with superb colours. Smart features are working fine. If you need a TV go for it without thinking much. The only thing need to improve is sound quality which is just average. After one month I am writing again about it. The TV is working well. It's a big TV in small budget. No matter of disappointment. Happy with my choice. The only one drawback is that when you paid it with Bluetooth you can't get a loud sound even when you keep all the sound levels ( tv , set top box and sound system) full.",Worth buying,B07X413J1G

Has latest bluetooth 5.0, connectivity is great. 4K is great, no audio/video lagging. They can provide more ram but 1.75gb is ok.

"I would recommend people to go for sanyo Kaizen series 43 inches over all other brands like VU , Mi, Kodak, Micromax , etc which are falling under the same price range . I googled the information almost for a week and then bought this TV during great Indian festival . Reasons are listed below- 1- Super bright LED( contrast ratio is Amazing ) 2-dolby audio (even at volume 4 you can watch all your serials ) but for music you can maximize as per you taste 3-Android certified (Google the difference between android certified and android based TV) 4- Android Pie 9.0 5- 1.75 GB ram 😃😃 6-Smooth functionality by remote with Google assistant. 7- Bluetooth 8-20 Watt speakers you will not need any additional home theatre 9-Dolby vision 10-HDR10 support 11-4K Resolution Guys I personally tested this TV even in day light with my window open and still I can see the colours looking so bright and clear .

"Sanyo 43 inch 4k smart tv is unbearable in its segment. Pros: Picture quality is nice & produce natural colors. Sound 2×10wts is also enough & good. Picture scaling is impressive Wifi Connectivity is quick & working nicely. 4k vedios running without leg. Comcast is one of the smart feature of tv. Goggle voice command Woking well. Apps are downloadable from playstore. Cons: Amazon prime is missing, hope that update come soon. Overall Sanyo 43 inch 4k smart tv is best as it is Japanese technology compare to other brand like LG, Samsung etc... Thanks Amazon for timely and safe delivery.

I was very septical to buy an HD ready TV Since I was using Samsung full HD tv. I am clad i went ahead and bought this TV after few hours of usage i don't find any different feel of watching HD ready.

"Bought Sanyo 43 Kaizen by this September and using it for some what 15 days, To be honest as it is described picture quality is quite amazing and plays HD and 4K videos the best and can be comparable with hight end TVs by Samsung LG etc. But sound is a bit disappointed. No that doesnt mean it is bad, its loud and clear but missing that Bass punch. Service from Panasonic is also on time and good. Over all in a budget range of 25K I must say Sanyo is best as compare to VU and others.",Its Awesome choice within 25K budget,B07X413J1G

"My childhood friend is back..I remember we own BPL Sanyo CRT during my childhood.. BPL collaborated with Sanyo in early 80s..BPL is now a separate entity nd Sanyo gone with Panasonic.. Few years back while searching for a new TV online, I accidentally found BPL nd I bought it without any 2nd thought nd now searching again for 2nd TV for my bedroom nd really very accidentally found this Sanyo..Now I have BPL+Sanyo in my home ( My old memories ).. Coming to performance of Sanyo: Great colors, excellent picture quality, very detailed picture in 4 k, HD is superb.. Sound is not up to the mark..Bass is woo weak. Smart features: U just need a good and fast internet..That's it nd rest all the inbuilt software will take care.. Really ur family will enjoy these colors nd details. What messed up: A big black shade appears on the right side of the screen when ever u press controls/buttons like Home, volume etc..When I raised this issue, the company Sanyo sent me an email saying that the shade is nothing but OSD (On Screen Display) ( Big let down for Japanese Technology )..""NOW I CHALLENGE THEM TO SHOW ME THE SAME IN ANY OTHE BRANDED TVs in INDIA OR ABROAD. LACK OF GUTS TO ACCEPT THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE ISSUE IN THE BUILT-IN ITSELF. Very tough to operate voice search through Remote control..There is no mic in this remote as claimed by the company. u must shout loud to access it..😂😂😂😂 U cannot make changes in Sound detailed quality or Pic detailed quality during live .. u must go back pressing few controls and then u can do it and again need to come back to watch.. Conclusion: Apaprt from the shade issue, One of the well known branded, latest Android equipped, Clean 4K picture with many other full packed features coming with a very reasonable nd pocket friendly price..What else u need to watch a Smart 4K latest TV...Just go for it. As simple as that.. (Yes u will face a bit problem when a shade appears but it's fine if u can feel it's ok..).. Update on 23rd Oct: SOund quality getting better and better.. Can hear clear sounds now. Voice search: Not that great but now working fine .. Need to speak a bit loud to avail voice search. Picture: Getting better and better in HD and 4K.. SD is not upto the mark.. Update 30-Oct : Really enjoying the TV with my family.. Connectivity is superb no lagging.. Just u need a good internet and rest all assured",JUST BUY IT..JUST BUY IT..,B07X413J1G
"I am very careful with my electronic gadgets purchase. I researched on Samsung, LG and Sanyo Smart TV for more than 2 weeks before deciding on Sanyo TV. Same dimension with Samsung and LG but much less priced because of less brand recognition maybe!? I ordered this with lot of anxious thoughts because I didn't go for a bigger brand. I have used it extensively for last 1 month - mainly to watch HD Movies and Live Cricket.. and until now I have NO complaints. Amazing picture quality, amazing built in speakers and Smart TV features are splendid. The build quality, plastics used were all up to the mark. Has built in Wi-Fi so connect directly with your YouTube, Prime Video, Netflix and Hotstar. You can also use Vodafone Play, and other popular video streaming apps. And don't worry, Sanyo is a sister concern for Panasonic from Japan - so electronics quality will definitely be great. Plus, Panasonic provides the servicing for the product.

"This is an excellent TV for the price. Picture quality merits 5 stars, & sound is quite good as well. I purchased a soundbar with subwoofer to go with it, & that has certainly added bass, depth & punch to the audio output. But even without the soundbar, the built-in speakers do a good job. Coming to the smart features, I've used Netflix & YouTube so far, and the experience is good. Netflix , in particular, is a breeze. YouTube takes a while to get used to, but that's the way YouTube is designed, nothing to do with the TV. Haven't tried other apps so far. The built-in Chromecast works perfectly, & casting from mobiles & my laptop works smoothly. I connected my old PC to the TV via a VGA to HDMi converter. I was prepared to be disappointed, but was pleasantly surprised. Even after passing through a budget converter, I am seeing PC visuals as I've never seen them before on a series of monitors. Bluetooth pairing of accessories takes somewhat longer than usual. At times, paired accessories (earphones, mobiles) do not work - music from mobiles cannot be sent to the TV, audio from TV does not output to Bluetooth wireless earphones. Unpairing & re-pairing the accessory is required to get things working again. Coming to delivery & installation, I'd ordered the TV on 29th September & selected 2nd October as date of delivery. But the TV was not delivered that day. That afternoon, I received an SMS saying that the delivery team had been unable to contact me & therefore delivery would be done next day.The SMS had a mobile number of the delivery person for me to contact. I spent that entire afternoon & evenining and next morning and afternoon trying that number. It was either switched off or no one would receive the call. On a few occasions someone received the call and, presumably, just kept the phone to one side leaving me going ""Hello, hello, hello..."" till I gave up in frustration and hung up. Finally I was forced to twice contact Amazon Customer Service who raised a complaint. The TV was finally delivered on the 4th. I got a call about installation the next day, and the installation man came on the 6th as arranged. The physical installation (wall mounting) was done efficiently. But he was rather casual about the setup, telling me I could easily do it myself later. Basically, he started the TV, showed me the Home screen, the Netflix button on the remote, told me briefly about using Google Assistant voice features, & left it that. As a first-time smart TV user, it took me the best part of a day with the manual to start using the TV with any sense of purpose. To sum up, I'm quite satisfied with the TV per se and would have given it 5 stars but for the poor delivery and installation experience.","Excellent TV, poor delivery",B07X413J1G
"I decided to buy this TV for playing ps4. The product quality is great whereas the sound and video quality is good but not great. When you play a 60fps video file or play PS4 games (not PS4 pro) it doesn't look like wat it is. There is some minor lag which can be clearly noticed. Even when u watch a YouTube video which has Full HD resolution and 60fps in the smartphone, we won't see any lag. I didn't expect this from a Panasonic brand. The display seems to be over bright and it hurts the eyes. I tried to change the picture settings but it didn't helped me. Regarding sound, this TV has 20W speakers. The sound is loud. However, when u watch a movie or play a game, it's very hard to hear what the character speaks. Iam planning to return than product. Edit (9-10-2019) There are few software bugs in the TV - Amazon prime gets logged out when you restart the TV - when a video is playing if you use volume control button, the videos is getting fast forwarded for one second - mobile cannot be connected through usb - any Bluetooth can be connected to the TV but if the TV is restarted, the paired device is not getting connected automatically to the TV.",Good product but not great though,B07X413J1G

To get a better experience, you can use the Bluetooth feature of this tv to couple it with a sound bar. The tv also has an in-built chromecast for you to cast your mobile contents. All-in-all, this is a brilliant device and a must-buy",Brilliant TV,B07X413J1G

"Please dont go for this TV. 1. Reason is when you increase or decrease the volume, automatically the video playing in YouTube or Amazon Prime or Netflix gets fast forwarded to 5 seconds ahead, disturbing the whole flow. 2. You will have to login & register everytime you watch a movie or video in Amazon Prime. 3. The Brightness, Conrast, Sound setups are reset to default even if you keep changing everytime. 4. Even after calling Sanyo Service Centres numerous times or giving negative feedbacks there is no response because they have received my payment. 5. Very much disappointed to know that both Sanyo & Amazon have collaborated in giving such disgusting gadgets. First I didnt believe when people said that Amazon sells all defective stuffs and goods but recently I have started feeling the same. Keep it up Amazon & Sanyo.",Disgusting Sanyo & Amazon,B07X413J1G

"Firstly I have issues with the TV, the audio and video sync is not correct and the optical connector is lose and it always falling down. The major issue is the support of 4K video, though it is said to be 4K TV it does not support HDCP 2.2 hence from Amazon Fire TV 4K Stick it can only play Full HD. Amazon misleading the customer with out providing the correct description of the product as with the lack of 4K support it can not be considered as 4K TV. Smart features are OK and the remote is so inconvenient to use with the TV, the picture quality is just average and voice recognition doesn't work always. I had good experience with Sanyo TB before so bought it again, however it turned to be a mistake. The quality of the product deteriorated.",Amazon misleading the customer with incorrect description of TV,B07X413J1G
"A Great product, i have used Sanyo products in the past and they are very good and lasts longer than most competitive products. 1.)Regarding XT-43A082U, Picture Quality 10/10 ,Audio is clear and crisp and loud but 9/10 cuz i need a little more bass but i can live with it . 2.)Setting up TV is breeze be it the stand or the TV configuration. 3.)Andriod Experience is good but there is noticeable lag , Amazon Prime and Google Chrome is missing and you cant even install it irony when amazon is the only platform it sells on. 4.)Customer care called and made sure the TV was installed/wall mounted and everything was okay Overall very happy with the product. speaks of the Japanese service and heritage of the Sanyo commitment. 5.)My only gripe is the wall mounting kits included is very basic one with no maneuverability, For the wall mount installation install kit which provide maneuverability costed me 1600/- and no receipt of it was provided. so i removed 1 star",Best 4k smart TV with Attractive Price,B07X413J1G
"After my experience with CloudWalker, which also promised same things (in fact lesser), but 4K video, android TV etc. I realised many gaps which starts to frustrate one as you get comfortable with the TV. The biggest value for me on this TV is the startup time - the picture is up and ready to go within 20 seconds! There is smooth integration with Netflix and other apps (am still waiting for Primevideo), Korean TV that my kids are crazy about. There is NO lag on ANY of the apps, video is smooth. A real pleasure to watch. The basic expectation on picture is easy - I have no great expectations, but this TV gives terrific pictures, even with back light (I have a window opposite the TV which was a problem with older TV). Andriod TV was something I realised I needed to demand - older TV had a hacked version of plain vanilla android and it does not work out so well. Sound quality is neat, no great shakes, but as I usually connect to my HD system, this is moot. In any case the TV sound is clear, used upto 75% and seen no problems. Voice recognition was never on my list, but having seen and used this, now I can stop the ""typing"" - still getting used to it, voice recognition seems a bit off, but not bad at all. Another surprise for me is the BlueTooth - works very smoothly with many devices (headphones) I connected - only wish we have a ""broadcast"" bluetooth so 3/4 headphones can be connected simultaneously. I strongly recommend this for all ""normal"" TV users over even Samsung/LG/Sony at this price range.",Smart TV that simply works - Buy It!!,B07X413J1G
"Received the TV as promised on the date. For installation received call on the delivery day and was installed on the same day. Picture clarity is very good as it is a 4K TV. It has got 3 HDMI ports & 2 USB ports. A / V input to TV is a EP socket, converter cable RCA to EP, is in the package. Set Top Box is connected through this cable. The quality of picture is limited to the quality of cable connection. You can connect external sound system via Bluetooth and HDMI. I have connected through Bluetooth. Fire TV stick is connected to one HDMI input, the video quality and sound quality is very good. I would recommend this product for the price range.",Value for money product with very good performance.,B07X413J1G

After going through all the features mentioned in the description, reading questions answered in the Q&A section and reading some reviews the one final thing which was the decision point was the company name. Sanyo is brand name of Panasonic and my past experience with Panasonic was always great. Great sound quality, not like one of those high-value home theatre systems but better than other TV options that i have seen. Latest Android and on time updates and patchs. In 43 inch modal Amazon Prime Video was not included but with new update its available now.

65inches sanyo was delivered promptly by Amazon on the 8th of Nov but no one has turned up for installation yet from Sanyo. Since 4 days I have been contacting to various toll free numbers of Sanyo for which I get excuses and sorry for which there is no meaning. Finally left with no choice I had to do the installation myself with my own risk. If installation itself is like this We need not think of their promising warranties. Anyways those purchasing a product from Sanyo forget about installations and warranties.,Worst customer service,B07X413J1G

"Major drawback 1. TV asks to power off in every 3 hrs. 2. Everytime TV gets power on it shows scan channel. 🤣 WTF 3. Power savings rating - 1* (that's worst for Panasonic brand ) Only option good is it's a smart TV. OS is quite slow. I suggest, opt for other brands, it's a cheap brand in the name of Panasonic.

Overview. 1) Brazzel for saying is thin 2mm in sides and 1 cm at lower level but since led screen is less by 1cm on all sides hence it hardly matters. 2)Cast feature where ever available at andoid app e.g voot works fine but for apps working need to check. 3) You tube working fine . 4) Google Assistant needs to be activated from tv settings for remote and remember remote consumes battery at fast pace. 5) Speakers : Hmm i have LG smart tv 2013 model it was expensive that time so comparing that didn't like the sound and Dolby.Now what to do suggest to adjust the sound from settings as per your liking with Bass &Treble. Or Attach 2.1 computer speakers they would improve. Installation & Service: Good Panasonic Network.Not to worry for 1 year. Overall Ok at the price.,Santo Kaizon 32 inch review.,B07X413J1G
"Picture Quality : I will give 5/5 to its picture quality.This is something you will never regret.Better colour reproduction, greater colour accuracy, wider viewing angles but screen loses brigthness slightly when viewed from side angle but Image is acurate. Cons: in-Built Chromecast :- Not satisfied with in-Built Chromecast as it lags. Audio and video signals out of sync even when you cast directly from apps.don't expect that it will performe like dedicated google chromecast dongle. Sound Quality : Satisfied with sound quality.loud enough. Smart Feature: I m OK with app support.all preinstalled apps like youtube etc work fine I have not tried prime video so can not comment on it.User interface is good no lag whatsoever.Apps can be sideloaded. Voice recognition function works smoothly Final Comment :- Its budget smart TV better than other local brands as it is manufactured and supported by Panasonic. Recommended for :- those who prefer to watch normal TV viewing like TV serials,movie,news etc Not recommended:- for sports,games, and high action lovers as it create blur effect in fast action scenes because of low panel response time.",Its budget smart TV better than other local brands,B07X413J1G

"I am writing the review after using more than one month. This tv is value for money. Picture quality awesome, but you should not compare with oled tv which price more than 1 lakh. I am playing YouTube videos with HD quality, it is running without lag smoothly. Navigating to Netflix is very easy, in remote a prominent key for Netflix available. Few people in comment section mention audio is low. I can say it is more than enough. If you want to play music for society, then it is not sufficient. I am the person who uses a product for few years, then replace it with new one so that I can enjoy whatever latest available in market. So I prefer discent quality with less price. I can say this is value for money.",Descent quality for money spent,B07X413J1G

"I do not have money to buy right now. But I have participated in the Amazon quiz to get this great lead. Whenever I get time, I watch a movie with my friend at her home on this led. Heart becomes happy",I love sanyo,B07X413J1G
"Nice TV. Initially, could not connect to Amazon Prime Video even after several attempts. However, as mentioned in the previous comments by SANYO, need to Reset the TV in order to use the Prime Video app login with your account.. When I chose to reset, it shows some update is going on, but won't be knowing how much percentage done or how much time left for the update completion or even don't know what is going on. So, I just waited for about 20 minutes and it still showed the same screen. I stopped the update at the moment. After doing this, just opened the Prime Video app and connected to my account without any issue. VESA screws type is different for this TV when compared to the ones I used it on my Samsung TV used earlier. And Installation person brought appropriate screws to fix it on my existing wall mount on the same day of delivery..",Worth it's price. Voice enabled Remote works well. Smart features are good.,B07X413J1G
Great value for money. Pros 1. Great picture quality. 4k videos look stunning. Even SD and 720p videos looks good. 2. Fast delivery and Installation. 3. Easy to use interface. 4. Latest android. 5. Slim design and minimal bezels. Cons 1. Amazon prime video is missing. Can't understand Why? 2. Poor remote. 3. Below average Sound quality. DTS not supported. Sound bar can solve this problem. 4. Black levels are not great but acceptable. So far all is good.,Nice TV,B07X413J1G
"Won't get disappointed. The best in the market among all those Chinese counterpart. Fastest delivery of Amazon, within a day installation. Some may get jargogle about the price when compared to the Chinese one. But believe the Japanese standard and panasonic service. My hall unit is a panasonic it's been with for nearly 7 years, till now no problem and haven't did any service. That's the power of japenese product and Sanyo got that legacy without a doubt. So definetely 4 star from me.",The best out there in the e-commerce market. ASSURED!!!,B07X413J1G
"Well, I am not a tech savvy guy. But let me put forth my views about this TV. While ordering a tv online and given so many options these days, I was really confused while placing the order. I wanted a good 4k tv for my bedroom. After flitting across on various ecommerce sites, I had this option of opting for either motorola or lg or samsung or Vu premium tv. Further, I have always been a very loyal customer of lg, so despite checking all the options again and again, I would come back to LG, but somehow while placing the order i chose this tv and i am really happy with my decision. I got this tv delivered on the auspicious day of dhanteras and got it installed the same day by the Panasonic technicians. GOOD JOB, AMAZON AND PANASONIC.The product was delivered on time and due care was taken while shipping this product by amazon. This 43"" 4k tv is just a show stealer in this price segment. Picture quality is just awesome. As I wanted this tv for my bedroom, so I had not connected this with tata sky. I made this an internet tv which runs smoothly on my fibernet broadband. Coming back to the review about this tv, look wise it looks sturdy, very thin bezels ( plastic, I feel it was done by the manufacturer to cut on the cost), sturdy back body, IPS display, 3 hdmi, 2 usbs, connects smoothly to the internet once it is powered on. Similarly connectivity to bluetooth devise is also smooth and connects automatically once powered on. Like all other smart TVs, this tv too has many useless apps which simply fills the interface and comes with only few useful preloaded apps like YouTube, hotstar, zee5, google play store (option very limited), google music, etc. You cannot add amazon prime ( you can cast though from your mobile) and other chrome cast compatible apps can also be cast on this tv which once configured works just smoothly. While switching between the apps, tv responds quickly with no lagas or latency issue. I was a bit disappointed with the sound though as it's very average, but when I got it connected with other bluetooth devices including my speakers i could feel the attributes of Dolby. I personally suggest adding external speakers to this tv for rich viewing experience. Further, I am yet to check this tv on tata sky with the hd channels and even the SD channels, but who cares, I don't even want to use these on this tv. Remote look wise is average, but its sturdy made of good quality plastic. The google assistance and voice search works just fine. You need to be a little slow and clear while giving commands, which is understandable. Therefore, if you are looking for a good budget 4k ultra hd tv in this price segment, go for it guys, without any second thought. Like I said if you have external bar speakers or surround sound, this combo can prove to be very deadly for you, it's just amazing. So what are you waiting for when you can have this beauty for just under 30k ( I got this at INR 25000). Wish you all a happy watching. ✌ And yes, one star i have deducted becoz of the inbuilt sound and the cheap bezels, the manufacturer have used for this tv, else i don't have any regrets.

But I am now happy that I have made a good decision. I am satisfied with all the features in this budget. In the lower segment of price this TV is the best among other TVs(after weeks of research). Panasonic service people called me and installed it in the very next day of delivery with free of cost. Those who are confused in the lower price segment smart TVs, I would say you can go for it. It is really paisa vasool!",value for money,B07X413J1G

"I’ve recently purchased the SANYO Kaizen 43” TV and I must say it’s the most value for money gadget I’ve ever spent on! Key Points and my views on that #1 - 4K: The picture quality is exceptional. You just can’t keep your eyes off the enchanting display quality. #2 - Design: WOW is the first word that comes to your mind when you talk about design. It’s Bezel less design adds the wow factor to the overall immersive experience, whilst adding a dash of style to the living room. #3 - Chromecast: The TV comes with built-in Chromecast where you can cast your phone directly on to big screen. #4 - Sound: It comes with Dolby Digital Audio and it does provide a theatre like experience when I’m on a binging spree. #5 - Apps: Prime video & Netflix are supported natively in the TV where you can enjoy hours of content easily. Also, there’s Google Play store where you can download your favorite apps and enjoy them all. #6 - Intuitive watching experience The remote with hot keys is a super simple experience, so much so that my 4 year old can navigate the UI like a pro. All in all, it does provide an ultimate Android TV experience.",Definitely recommended!,B07X413J1G
"I searched these tvs VU,MI & SANYO... as VU is NEW and does not have customer service in my city i didnt selected & for MI i found -ve reviews & no customer service not able to consider this too..and SANYO is from PANASONIC i trusted this & Earlier i have good customer help for my PANASONIC AC. so i preferred this & it is the Best 32inch TV in this Price Range..Voice assistant working Awesome, Picture quality is Superb,Web browsing is Fast. Dolby sound is Excellent... Worth the Money which we spend Panasonic Guy not able to explain all features in this TV , He just only installed TV. Still not able to install CHROME or LIVE TV in my set..if anybody know if explains its good. Please don't listen to people saying Prime Video not Working may be their TV is old. My TV is 100% working good with every feature as mentioned in product",BEST TV value for money,B07X413J1G
"TV is absolutely very good, especially picture and sound quality is awesome which you normally see in high end TVs costing above 2-3 Lakh. As of now I am very happy and satisfied with Sanyo. Two drawbacks I observed, 1. Amazon prime inbuilt is not there,we have to chrome cast. 2. Voice recognizing is not good(3 🌟). I don't understand why it is not mentioned that, it is a UHD 4k TV any where on TV or packing box. Even technician suspected that is it 4k. Please someone have any idea about it , please comment. Let me see down the line for few days and will update the review how it is. Overall it's value for money.",Fantastic picture and sound Quality. 5 🌟 .,B07X413J1G
"Best Budget TV, Good Panel, Prime Video not available even though sold through amazon but can be cast through built-in chrome cast, have to ask them whether they plan on pushing it through an update. SD channels(no loss in picture quality) good. Good Contrast tuned it, IPS Panel does the job but don't expect deep blacks not an Oled. Instead of 1.75Gb ram & 8Gb rom, 16Gb rom & 2Gb ram would have been a good improvement for all 4K Versions.",5 star. On festival offer TV had 4k discount.,B07X413J1G
The TV runs fine as long as it runs but it keeps restarting after a while. When SANYO technicians came over they were not very sure what was wrong. One said it is a motherboard issue and another said it was a hardware issue. is anybody else facing the issue of restart?,Not sure if product is good,B07X413J1G
It doesn't have more app like jio tv and many other apps. Cast your tv function does not work at all. Picture quality is very bad. I am unable to install jio tv and other apps. When I run any app it does not run smoothly. I think it is not better tv only good,Plz clear all your wishes and questions before buying this tv,B07X413J1G

Trustworthy & all India service by panasonic is a delightful experience. This is the most reliable & trustworthy brand with dependable & Trustworthy service back up. Cut throat competition in Android TV segment, with xiaomi, TCL, Telefunken, Kodak, Vu, Motorola, Blaupunkt etc, but service is poor & not dependable. Sanyo is the best, with assured japanese obsession for excellence in product quality & trustworthy & Dependable service back up all over India. Just go for it. Peace of mind is assured.",Excellent & superb,B07X413J1G

Nice. Good Picture quality Sounds Best,Value for money,B07X413J1G
"I was familiar with products of Sanyo and was happy to go with the brand. I have no regrets. The picture quality is the main talking point as is the overall finish and service. What was good: 1. Picture quality. A little tuning (turn down the sharpness) gives you premium image quality at a budget price. Great image quality. 2. Service: Amazon delivered the next day and Sanyo (Panasonic) installed the day after. The product came safely packaged and the wall installation went of very smoothly. The technician left my house at 10pm - that is the sort of dedication I can pay money for. I got a follow up call from Sanyo two days later to find out if installation went well and if I was happy with the product. What more can you ask for! 3. Android and Chromecast: Chromecast works perfectly. I can cast Prime Video and watch without any glitches. I have also connected headphones and speakers effortlessly with Bluetooth. Android works well but with some issues that needs sorting out. 4. Finish: The product is not flashy. It has a dignified appearance and can go with any decor. What can be Better: 1. Software. I have major issues with the ""input"" button as it does not take me to the TV connection. I have to switch to TV from the ""Source"" button. This needs a software update fix. The technician was unable to fix the issue. 2. Some apps do not work - ZEE5, for example, does not open. Maybe it is an issue with ZEE, but it is frustrating. 3. The sound quality is good but not great. It is an issue with most budget down-firing speakers and my premium Panasonic TV also suffers from this problem. I listen through a soundbar, so it is not a big issue for me - but buyers should be aware of this minor shortcoming. The negatives do not take away from the sheer enjoyment of watching quality content at less than Rs 25K - so I will rate this TV ""5 Star"" in its segment.","Best budget 43"" 4K Smart TV",B07X413J1G
"Brilliant product at such a low price point! ONLY DRAWBACK is that there is ONLY 1 nos. Audio Out (Digital Audio Out) in the TV. So, ONLY 1 person can use headphones via bluetooth to watch TV without distracting the children studying in the house etc. Second pair of headphones will NOT pair with the TV via bluetooth. Because of this, my Tewtross Bluetooth transmitter device which can supply audio to TWO pairs of headphones by connecting to my old LCD TV via the standard 3.5mm Headphones Out jack has now become useless. The obvious workaround this problem now is to keep the AV receiver / Amplifier switched on all the time the TV is on, and feed the Digital Audio Out from this TV into the Amp and then connect the Tewtross Bluetooth Transmitter to the Amp to feed two sets of headphones via Bluetooth. Irritating! What was the big cost savings to Sanyo not to provide a piddly 3.5mm headphones jack in this 43""TV?? Such a disappointment over such a small item.",Limitation in Audio Out options!!,B07X413J1G
On time delivery. Installation within one and half hour after delivery. Two engineers came for installation. Knowledgeable persons. Excellent picture quality. Need some setting changes for sound. Then you will get the good sound. Casting ok but some lagging. Google Assistant work well. No issue on remote. Need a HD connection for dth/cable for better viewing. No issue on wifi. YouTube working fine. 4k videos are excellent. Go for it. After all it's a Panasonic product.,Awesome 👍,B07X413J1G
Picture quality is acceptable for the price. It is slighly yellowish. Pixel density is good given 4K UHD for 43 inch screen size. Prime videos is missing but you can side load with apk with armv7 version and it will work fine. Sound is loud and clear. Installation was so-so as I called twice and eventually I got it installed with my trusted Electrician on flexible mount. You can go with this 4k Android TV if your budget is very tight.,Good for the Price,B07X413J1G

So I was in search of a 43 inch 4k tv and same time it was rigorously advertised on Amazon.in...I thought it meets my requirement and to my surprise, it actually does. Picture quality is amazing, 4k videos run smoothly (need good internet speed though). Sounds quality is good enough. Overall tv performance is really good...I even checked the comparison of Mi tv and this one, the latter had got better reviews ( Sanyo has ips display). Overall this is a good buy and I'm enjoying it...BTW I got this at 23,250 during sale.",Amazing 4k tv,B07X413J1G

Hotspot connectivity from mobile data makes you to play video on lots of app like youtube, hostar, jio cinema etc. I purchased it on offer period through icici card and get 10% instant discount. That's good. I have one question: how to connect mobile to this tv? I mean mobile view. I have one more tv that is Thomson's led, which is so easy to connect mobile to this by miscast function. But in this tv I don't find miscast app or option to connect my phone to this tv.",How to connect mobile to led or is there miscast function in this led?,B07X413J1G
"Pros: Slim and light weight Picture quality is good at this budget Audio is clear and loud enough Android certified, so get access to play store Cons: No prime video, not even in play store A bit washed out color with default settings Android TV is not a polished and mature platform Voice recognition is at par Considering the price point it is one of the best options. I compared with iFalcon, Vu, Thomson, Marq etc and it stands out in both picture and audio quality.",Better than other Chinese products in this price segment,B07X413J1G
