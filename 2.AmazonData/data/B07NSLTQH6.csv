It's was very bad experience with Samsung TV. In just 30 days showing this screen. Provide me customer service.,Defective T. V,B07NSLTQH6
Really unfortunate to get a defective screen...used it only for 4-5days. Such an awesome Tv otherwise.,Unlucky to get a defective screen,B07NSLTQH6
"I contemplated buying one of those cheap Chinese brand first but I had heard so many horror stories from friends about the poor quality and limited service availability, that i eventually went for a premium product. I have a lot of products from Samsung at home and I am very happy with them so I went for Samsung. Sharing my observations from using it for a few days: - The TV was delivered and installed on time without any follow ups. - It is a top notch premium Iooking UHD TV with sharp pictures and good brightness. Clearly, Samsung picture quality cannot be replicated by Chinese TVs. - The sound is loud enough for my room size and vocals clarity is awesome. It has dolby digital. I used the Tune Station app once-it allows me to play music while the TV screen is off. - I sometimes pair my phone with the TV. Screen mirroring works smoothly without any lag. It also has a live cast function which I used once and it worked like a dream. - Another thing that stands out (and is missing in TVs like MiTV) is the pre-built VoD apps such as Netflix, Prime, Hotstar, Zee 5 etc. - The TV is extremely easy to control. Its interface is clutter free. I could easily navigate through the TV menus from the first time I switched it on. - Overall, a wonderful TV at this price. Strongly recommended!","Amazing product, highly recommend!!!",B07NSLTQH6
"Brought the tv at 49,999. Incredible clarity, color and picture quality. Ticks a lot of boxes and carries an tempting price tag. Pros: Excellent motion handling Very good HDR performance 20w dolby digital audio Cons: Doesn't have Bluetooth connectivity",The best 4k tv of 2019,B07NSLTQH6
"Hardly used this TV for 3 months. it stopped working. When called technician from samsung, he is suggesting not to buy TV from Amazon. When asked for replacement, they are saying we cant. When asked samsung customer care to give in writing that they cant replace faulty piece. They are plainly saying 'No we won't' Do not buy this model. Customer service of samsung is aweful. After spending 50k on a TV, i am left with worst experience ever on amazon.",Sub-standard product--- DO NOT BUY THIS FAULTY MODEL,B07NSLTQH6
"Bought this on 16th June and on 10th July ( less than a month) the HDMI1 port stopped working. Now running around and Samsung people come, check and then keep taking time to send someone else. Now talking about changing motherboard. This is the quality Samsung gives that in less than a month a TV gets spoilt and it's like now having a second hand TV. Won't do a replacement which ethically should be done My suggestion is not to buy this!",Defective pc recd,B07NSLTQH6
Picture quality amazing 720P + videos looks flawlwss Sound is ok ok. on my Sony tv was better Now thing to consider Remote is seriously old style. No bluetooth so can not use any other. Buttons are closaly placed so its very hard to use Smart feature is almose useless becouse of remote. If you plane to use it with mi box or firestik go for it otherwise as smart tv ? Not worth.,Remote downplayed otherwise fantastic TV,B07NSLTQH6
"Got this UHD tv for 50k. At this price point I would say it’s a sweet deal. Coming to the features it’s packed to the brim. Picture clarity, sound quality is excellent. Only thing I dislike is the remote which is not smart. Also it doesn’t have Bluetooth which is a letdown by Samsung",Go for it !,B07NSLTQH6
"The picture quality is really good but lacks right amount of refresh rate for playing UHD videos, although it is a UHD certified 4K TV. The sound output is nice but amplification at some instances is required for appropriate audibility. The TV goes into loop startup sometimes where it won't start even if you keep pushing the power button, this problem seemed to resolve by it's own if you wait for few more seconds. I'm not sure whether it happened with the others but I get screen blink (during loop) after pushing the power button just like when the TV was trying to power up it's display but the power cuts off. Hope the review helps others. Thanks for spending your time reading this.","It doesn't come with the conventional AV IN slots, please consider it before you buy.",B07NSLTQH6
Everything’s perfect but the remote it’s very basic and smart features become tough to use,No Bluetooth for changing remotes,B07NSLTQH6
The product I received had an issue with the motherboard,Defective Product,B07NSLTQH6
"Should be very careful before ordering as it does not support wireless 5G and also Voot and other app cant be downloaded. It's not android OS, for most app to work you need to buy amazon stick extra. Be very careful. Tried to return but was not successful as they dont entertain these reason or case. Read return policy term very carefully before ordering Samsung TV from Amazon.",Not support most of android support. No return,B07NSLTQH6
"I was looking to purchase UHD TV for so long. And surprisingly Samsung launches UHD models in beginning of March 2019. And I felt lucky that time that I waited for right product. This is hands down the best model in market (at price of Rs 49,999 for 50 inch model).",Great UHD TV by any company so far,B07NSLTQH6
Not able to install jio TV app,Software installation issue,B07NSLTQH6
Samsung should have marketed a better remote control for this TV which is disappointing. Also 3D picture support missing in this TV which is a shortage feature in this price range. Better buy other brands in this range,Smart features not up to mark,B07NSLTQH6
This product should be supporting Bluetooth but there is no option of Bluetooth? Secondly where is the 60k + movies as claimed. The Non-HD channels are very low quality!!!,Feedback,B07NSLTQH6
"Reviewing the UA50NU6100 50 inch 4k smart led tv after 12 days. Awesome 4k led smart 50 inch tv with in the budget models from samsung. It has pur colour technology, which shows rich colours. It has good black level contrast which produces real blacks, as it uses back led light(direct led technology) which will be always on and off on the necessity of the light for the picture. It has good bright levels. Sound is great as it has Dolby digital plus. Uhd dimming is good. It has HDR 10+. Tizen OS with Apps like amazon prime video,Netflix,YouTube, Hot star, jio etc. Wifi works fine and also it has screen mirroring,chromecast,live-cast(exclusive in samsung 4k led tv's) etc. (1 Optical cable port,1 terrestrial port, 2 hdmi port and 1 usb port. ) Picture quality 9.5/10. Sound quality 10/10. Smart features 10/10. Samsung Service 9/10. Con's Bluetooth is absent. Only 2 hdmi port. (1 arc , 1 video). Only 1 USB port. Ordinary type Remote.",Excellent 4k led smart tv among the budget models,B07NSLTQH6
"Just installed it yesterday, so far I'm loving it. Just few heartbreakers 1) Remote is basic, nothing smart. No voice control. 2) Voice cracked a bit on high volume while using cast. I was using Amazon music app on phone and casted it to TV. So noticed a little cracking. And even some volume fading. But on Gaana app installed in TV , music worked fairly good. 3) Screen was not filling in Hotstar and Netflix... although did fill full screen while watching YouTube videos. 4) More apps would be welcome as im still not sure I should discard my FireStick or not. Apart from these sore points I'm happy with my purchase. Special thanks to Amazon for the speedy delivery as Flipkart had disappointed me for the same and they returned TV midway and later blamed me that I cancelled the order, which I never did. They requested me to cancel saying they can't deliver. Still i dint cancel.",Thanks Amazon for speedy delivery. Great purchase.,B07NSLTQH6
"Terrible experience! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT AND DEFINITELY NOT FROM THIS SELLER! I got this product today, at first was beautiful now I noticed backlight bleeding all over the screen. I tried to replace the product but they transferred my call to a so called tech person who does not even know what backlight bleeding is. I tried explaining the problem and he was like they will send a tech person for inspection after two days and send a report and then decide what to do. Pathetic service from Amazon.",DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! Definitely not from this seller,B07NSLTQH6
"For this price tag, Sound quality, Video quality & Smart features are good enough. It would have been nice if smart remote is part of the package. Frame is small thereby good screen to body ratio. Haslefree connectivity to internet. There is a shortage of HDMI port. There are only 2. Nowadays people connect gaming consoles, Sound bar, dish connections or Streaming devices. 2 would not be sufficient for many users.",Worth for the price tag,B07NSLTQH6
One of the finest quality picture with 4K UHD TV. Keep it up!,Excellent Product!,B07NSLTQH6
"I would have given it five star except for the sound which is a little bit of a disappointment when I compare it with my older Sony model. When it was installed, the sound seemed a little too bass, it reverberated and sometimes it was difficult to make out the dialog. I was about to invest in a Bluetooth speaker which would have been expensive since this model has only a optical out and would have needed an optical to Bluetooth converter. But fortunately, the problem was solved adequately by setting the equalizer. I reduced the lower two frequencies by two notches and the sound became much clearer. But it is still just a little bit behind the Sony. Everything else is great. Picture Quality is superb and USB playback works for all the formats I tried. WiFi works nicely. Installation was smooth and professional and the latest wall mount quality and simplicity was good. One cannot expect more at this price; A Samsung Brand TV backed by Samsung name and support.",Excellent Values for Money,B07NSLTQH6
The glitch occured many times while i watching tv so plz tell what do i do to this,Glitch occured many times,B07NSLTQH6
"Great picture quality but the viewing angles are too bad. It seems like a milky curtain has been out on the screen when we view it from an angle. But that's not product specific, almost all 4K TV's have the same problem.",Poor Viewing Angles,B07NSLTQH6
"Defective piece was delivered to me. The features of wireless display from Laptop or Mobile phone is not working properly. My HP laptop is not all able to connect to the TV. Also if I connect my mobile phone, it gets connected but then after 5-10 mins it gets automatically disconnected . The Samsung Technical engineer said that Samsung TV many times does not connect to a HP laptop(I have a brand new HP laptop) through a wireless display feature. The engineer had no answer of why mobile phone is getting disconnect . He tested with his own mobile phone and even that was getting disconnected.",Defective piece,B07NSLTQH6
"I got TV and I requested service support . They allocated a person and sent me his phone number. I called him in morning, he told me he will come soon. We waited full day leaving our work but he not visited us. When I called him at evening he told he didn't get any job order he cannot visit. After I told him everything he told now only I got your job order I will visit after two days.",Worst service support by Samsung,B07NSLTQH6
"No smart remote. Some type of pattern, like a bad CD is playing type, appears when TV is switched on. Sound modes not satisfactory. No Bluetooth. The 60K+ plus titles 90% premium. Free ones are those dubbed from other languages.",Not too smart,B07NSLTQH6
No Bluetooth No Aux output No audio out put only HDMI output Optical audio output available Pic quality ok Screen mirror super Try to buy on sbi card for low money,I like pic quality,B07NSLTQH6
"Bought this in 2019’s Great India Festival. Switching from a 32 inch Vu LED Tv, the experience has been great. Ultra HD 4K TV, that too from Samsung, stands out in picture clarity. Another huge plus is Samsung’s sound quality which you’ll never get from cheaper Chinese/Indian counterparts, although one drawback is the missing dolby config. Picture is great, but a refresh rate of 60 Hz is noticeable when things move fast. But then again, all the TVs in this range come at this frequency. Remote is with a lot of unnecessary keys. I’m still fine with it, but my parents find a hard time trying to find online content like Netflix. To sum up, pros outweigh the cons and, yes, it’s a good call to pick this instead of a 30K Vu TV or an Mi TV.",Good buy at the price,B07NSLTQH6
"Value for money.Superb picture quality.Sound is good ,though the Bass could have been better..The front panel could have been made more attractive which could have given rich look to the overall T.v But for the price ...it's worth",Value for money,B07NSLTQH6

"Its the best priced embedded with all new features. Clarity aspect, sound is very good. One back log is no smart remote for a smart TV.",Value for money - Ultra High definition is damn good,B07NSLTQH6
The TV is very good . Most important factor is amazon commitment to install with in 48 hours is maintained . The support from Samsung is also equally good,Good product and good support from Samsung,B07NSLTQH6

"What works: Best in class display Great pair of speakers Responsive UI Supports all the major streaming services What doesn’t: Voice input is absent Standard, old-school remote No proper Google Cast alternative No India-specific features like Patchwall The Samsung NU6100’s most striking attribute is its 43-inch screen which goes nearly edge-to-edge. The bezels especially disappear when you’re watching a dark-themed piece of content such as Stranger Things on Netflix. Built largely out of plastic, the television has an arched rear that’s thin enough to not stick out if you mount it on a wall. While it’s not as slim or bezel-less as",Compelling almost all the features of a high class premium 4k Smart TV,B07NSLTQH6
"Excellent Tv, great picture quality and good sound. Been using for about a week and a half now and it's working great. Looks like it's got HDR and the contrast is excellent and the blacks are awesome for a standard LED TV. If you're okay with only 2 HDMI and 1 USB port, then it's fine. There's a slight lag sometimes but I'm okay with it.",Brilliant TV,B07NSLTQH6

The picture quality is just excellent 5/5 as the colour reproduction is spot on also the blacks are perfect, has all the necessary smart features expected from such a TV so in terms of that 4.5/5 and in terms of sound quality bass is moderate so as per myself it gets 4/5.",Great overall package!,B07NSLTQH6

"A pathetic product from Samsung. Sound completely goes blank at times, even after replacing the motherboard the issue persists.

Bang for the buck. Average TV user cannot make out difference between what this offers at this price and higher priced higher spec TV s.

Best in Class Display type LED VERY Best Picture Sounds Amazing 4k Performance Excellent Connecting Fast and very easily but Really 4K,Brilliant Samsung Super 6 Ultra HD 4K,B07NSLTQH6
"This is the first smart TV I have ever ordered. From a layman's point of view, the picture quality is brilliant, even for a 4K resolution, along with the sound which is fantastic. For those who were expecting a smart remote are in for a disappointment. Moreover, the playback and rendering is smooth and without a glitch. Most of the TV apps are available like Netflix, Zee5, Hotstar, Jio Cinema, Amazon Prime, Hooq, Sony Liv etc., but don't expect a Google Playstore as it is not an Android TV. The TV apps are optimised for a comfortable streaming and Netflix works the best. As far as inputs are concerned, there are 2 HDMI ports, 2 USB ports, and a 3.5 mm AUX output. If you don't have an HD set top box, then you may have to get one. Sound is the key takeaway and you won't need an additional speaker or soundbar for sure.",Good for a start,B07NSLTQH6
Awesome product by Samsung. value for money also. Product mentions true 4K. I am a Samsung user for many years. Very reliable products.,Quality product at great value,B07NSLTQH6
Best product by Samsung company Best picture quality Best sound Best surround sound Best in everything Best best best best,Best,B07NSLTQH6
"If you need best viewing experience be amazed , just go for it , other brands other than sony and lg dont buy. Samsung picture quality is best than main competitors mentioned.",Best quality,B07NSLTQH6
"I bought this TV through Amazon on 4th October 2019. In one month started facing issues where the TV gets switched off on it's own and the power light keeps blinking. Lodged a complaint at the Samsung helpline and they arranged for a technician to check the fault. The technician is stating that the fault is with the mother board which needs to be changed. Hardly a month and fault with the mother board? I have asked for a replacement. But really losing faith in Samsung products. Horrible experience, think twice before you go for this product.",TV is getting switched off and not able to switch it on,B07NSLTQH6
"Got a defective one first time.. it wasn't starting on first press of remote button.. taking 8-10 minutes to on.. registered complaint for same and Samsung had to replace mother board... So ultimately, new TV had to get repaired so it was really a bad experience.. but now it's working totally fine after that",Not great for sure,B07NSLTQH6
"What's worse than the reliability of this tv is Samsung's service. After multiple calls to them, the only thing they are consistent with is reiterating that if the product is faulty it's not their fault. It's their policy. If it works good for you and if on doesn't buy another tb because Samsung won't be helping you. Defeats the purpose of buying a Samsung product. Final verdict. Don't buy this tv if you're looking at long term use.",Samsung's not what it used to be. Stick to budget tvs. Easily replaceable.,B07NSLTQH6
"Product is amazing, perfect picture clarity, easy function, very happy with the Samsung Technician who did the job on right time and with perfection. Only challenge is sound quality not that great",Great product by Samsung by loyal customer since 2008,B07NSLTQH6
"Where is app download option, frustrating and what old model remote is given. Even the three year warranty given on Facebook tv looks wrong, Amazon representative don't have any clue of that. I recommend not to buy this tv instead buy any normal non smart TV and use fire stick. Anyways we have to use fire stick. Upset with this product","App download options not there, waste",B07NSLTQH6
GREAT DISPLAY AND QUALITY. SMOOTH AND CONVENIENT USAGE. MULTIPURPOSE AND DYNAMIC. MUST BUY AT THE PRICE QUOTED. GREAT SOUND QUALITY.,GOOD PRODUCT. GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY,B07NSLTQH6

Hope the features get upgraded in new TV products by Samsung. Still, if you want reliable service and good picture quality, this is undoubtedly the 'go-for'.
