Just now updated Android version nd that is not working. First off all they delayed updates nd then unstable Android version. Finally Chinese company started showing there colour. I am not able to do any thing except YouTube.,Bad support,B081Z1RQLV
"The product is unexpectedly nice and does what has been claimed by Xiaomi. Delivery was also carried out in a perfect manner, as the TV was shown by the Amazon staff to be in a perfect condition. You need to call Mi Call Center and fix an appointment for installation. There seems to be a minor software glitch in YouTube as the video gets stuck mid-way while playing 4K videos, however, Amazon Prime plays 4K videos perfectly. Bought this against Samsung RU7100, which stands nowhere near this Television from Xiaomi. Hope the TV survives for 5 years minimum.",Must buy!!,B081Z1RQLV

"THIS is my first smart tv experience,like many of us ,I was little hesitant to put my hard earn money in this tv. so this review of mine is for people who like to do little research and home work before they buy anything. There are many reviews on flipkart positive as well as negative about the product. I have used LG and Samsung tv before buying this one. 1 picture quality :- very nice.crisp and clear picture with no blurry images or any tint(as may have mentioned in some reviews) 2 Sound:- I find it satisfactory ,dont expect home theatre kind of experience with 20 watt speakers. 3. connectivity :- again no complaints and satisfactory. I never had any problems while connecting it to Bluetooth audio or wi fi. 4. Lag free and very smooth..UI is beautiful. 5. Native support to Netflix and Prime Video 4K content Overall super happy with the purchase","The Best 55"" TV you will ever need",B081Z1RQLV
If you to frustrate with headache for installation then go for it. Don't know why selling the product if can't support the customer.,pathetic service,B081Z1RQLV
