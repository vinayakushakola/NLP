"I bought this TV, As it is an android TV it should have Amazon Prime & Netflix. But both applications are restricted in playstore by MI - So I told them to place a return request but they are not accepting it. Saying you should have to confirm it before placing an order. So now on If i will have to buy any android mobile, I will have to call them and confirm all the thousands of applications which is available in playstore - asking whether this applications are supported in mobile or not. Screen quality is too poor. I am prime member of Amazon - But I am saying now never buy anything from Amazon - Cancelling my subscription of Amazon prime as well",Never buy TVs from AMAZON,B07HB7SSPZ
"The picture quality is not good. Resolution is poor with HD connection of my DTH connected through an HDMI cable even though it's an HD ready TV. I didn't find any difference in picture quality with HDMI and RCA inputs. Greenish hue with pixelated appearance of the image was seen even in close view, perhaps defective. Sound quality is okay in low volume but clarity is lost and crackles with medium to high volume. The built is flimsy. But I admire Amazon for it's customer care services for smooth return and refund of the product for which I would give five stars.",Poor resolution and color saturation.,B07HB7SSPZ
"I will suggest all who are buying this in the name of Smart Android Tv. This is totally pathetic product and you will regret it and when you try to return it Amazon customer care will make a number of excuses and keep your phone on waiting for more than 30 minutes by just transferring call here and there to a different department. Let me tell you why. 1) They say ultra-bright display. You will see your own face while paying youtube video on this tv. what kind of ultra-bright display it is? 2) They say built-in chromecast . A built-in chromecast which does not support any Netflix, Amazon. Tell me what kind of chromecast is on this tv? 3) They mentioned on the HDMI port as HDMI ARC. When I try to connect tv with my home theater it not delivering any sound to home theater. I try it by playing youtube on TV. 4) While writing this review. I am on call with Amazon. It has been 32 minutes and Amazon customer care is transferring my call to next and next department and nobody assures me that they will return the product or refund me. I will upload a video of how the display quality it. Please do not purchase in the name of Android instead purchase a normal tv with IPS display.",Pathetic video quality.,B07HB7SSPZ
"I bought it in October. Got delivered fast, on October 13 i got this tv ans has been using it ever since. Today on January 4th, the Android suddenly crashes and displays this message. There is an option to factory reset but nothing is happening. Now have to give this to some customer care centre to get it fixed. When it works, it is real good. WHEN IT WORKS. Update: I contacted Mi customer care yesterday and they were able to resolve the issue in no time. I was concerned that i had to take it to the service centres or send to back to Mi like we do for mobile replacement. To my surprise i was told that THERE ARE NO SERVICE CENTRES CURRENTLY FOR Mi TV's. No service network at all. The customer care executive told me If the issue exists even after the fix is tried, i had to register for an installation request and then have the technician coming in for TV installation take a look at the TV to fix the issue. Other than that, I don't think Mi has any service options for their customers.",MUST READ THIS BEFORE BUYING: Android in it crashed within 3 months : It was an easy fix though.,B07HB7SSPZ
Installation takes ages.Still not installed 7 days have passed.,Never ever.,B07HB7SSPZ
Bought this MI 32 inch 4C PRO Smart LED TV two months back and now the TV’s system got crashed while watching through wifi network. Contacted MI Customer care & they ensured that service engineer will attend the case within 24 hours. But no one called or came. Upon calling they denied giving the service engineer’s contact No. A very poor service from MI Customer care. Not at all reliable and supportive.,Very poor customer service/support in case of fault,B07HB7SSPZ
"Bad product marinated in marketing flavor.its totally mi's misleading add. Picture and sound quality pathetic, in same range Micromax canvas 3 display and sound is way better than this. Those who are thinking to purchase it is no where near to reputed brand.Amazon delivery and installation was good and on time as promised.",Only misleading advertisment,B07HB7SSPZ
"Pros: 1. Very Good Picture quality with nice sound system. 2. A nice TV with Android & Chromecast facility in Low Cost. 3. Wifi functionality is perfect. 4. Google voice search works fine. 5. Chormecast working fine. Cons: 1. Amazon Prime Video & Netflix could not be found pre-loaded and could not be installed via play store. 2. I can't find any pre-loaded browser by default. 3. With some efforts using computer we can install some apps like (Amazon Prime Video, Netflix & Chrome) 4. We could not choose default TV Input(AV Mode) when we put on TV. Because of this every time we have to choose input source for AV Mode. If these defects are rectified in future through updation, this tv would be the best low cost tv available in Indian Market.",Very good features in low cost,B07HB7SSPZ
"I have been purchasing multiple products over Amazon since its advent, sometimes even amounting to 1 lakh. I haven't reviewed a single item ever in my life. This time I am forced to. A brief timeline: A) Since this product was an Android TV at a steal price, I bought it, until realizing a big gaffe I had made. B) I received the product on 28th October. I was told not to unbox it until MI support did so. C) Mi support unboxes and wall mounts the TV on 31st. To both of our surprise, the remote is not present in the box. D) As a guileless person who trusts values, I thought it of a minor mistake and raised a case with MI care. Even Mi installation guy raised a case internally. E) After numerous followups (spending almost 2+hours), I was apprised on 1st Nov that ""as per internal investigation was done by MI, the package delivered to me was intact"". F) I have been still following up with MI, and the TV is useless because it needs remote for the initial setup. In a nutshell, we all believe MI products are great. The phones definitely are but cannot say exactly about TVs. I understand we all tend to buy amazing products at great deals. Everyone should. But one needs to be careful of why still Samsung or Sony are finest. That is because they value their customers. It is all about ethics and principles. If MI cannot trust the integrity of its customers, then neither am I bound to.","Be cautious of MI support. No offence to Amazon, which has been great as always.",B07HB7SSPZ
"This has to best among all smart TVs below 20K available in market today and let me tell you why. Crystal clear picture quality. I have Samsung and Sony Led in other rooms purchased at much higher price but still MI TV delivers at par with Sony and much better than Samsung. Guys there is hardly any difference in Full HD and HD ready at 32 Inch size. I found no recognizable difference when both content played even side by side. Inbuilt Andriod Play Store, Youtube, Pathwall and Chrome Cast is amazing. You can play any file format including 4K content smoothly. DTS Sound quality is mesmerising. Gives you perfect cinematic experience. My Sony Bravia and Samsung counterparts in other rooms are no where close in sound quality. The only con I found was ease to connect chromcast. You need to download Google Home app in smartphone which you want to connect.",Gives you much more Value than its Price,B07HB7SSPZ
Never Buy It..This is TCL product which is imported by Mi..Not manufacturer by Mi... Photo attached. These people are cheating..When you are going to return it not accepting return request.,Never Buy It..This is TCL product,B07HB7SSPZ
"The description is incorrect. It is a HD ready TV and not a Ultra HD TV. Meaning, no 4K TV...",The description is incorrect,B07HB7SSPZ
"Strongly do not recommend this TV. SMART TV Features - NO Netflix, NO Amazon Prime Video. Even using inbuilt Chromecast, we CANNOT cast from Netflix / Amazon Prime Video mobile apps - DISGUSTING. DISPLAY - Absolutely worst display. There are bright spots at random locations on the screen, the picture clarity is also very bad. Colors are not accurate too. THIS IS NOT a A+ grade panel. SOUND - Worst sound output ever i have seen on a TV. Sound is distorted and not audible CLEARLY. Can't even hear the words properly. Must be some cheap Chinese speakers. Not many useful apps in the google play store. A big let down. Did a BIG MISTAKE by buying this TV. Totally REGRET it. Suggest you to go for A+ panel displays. This is no Smart TV with missing netflix and prime video apps inbuilt. All the other stupid apps like hungama, etc, we need to signup which is a headache. My sincere suggestion - DO NOT BUY MI TVs. They are worst than MICROMAX Tvs. Total waste of money buying this Mi TV.",WILL NOT RECOMMEND,B07HB7SSPZ
"Wonderful Smart Tv from MI. Display Clarity is mind-blowing, Awesome Picture Quality with Dishtv HD Setbox , Nice Sound , Google Chromecast works Smoothly , no any lagging issue. I purchased it on 13 October 2018 , After 15 days of use I wrote this review.",Mind-blowing Purchase Of Mi Tv From Amezon India,B07HB7SSPZ
I ordered for the mi led and it gives me the installation date of 20 October. However I received the message on 18 October and I was satisfied but due to the reasons I was out of station and my parents were at home. They ask the service men to fix the setup box stand but he totally refuse to do so. Even for changing the position of drill holes he demand 250rs extra for each. His behavior was very rude. I'm highly disappointed with the service of MI and would only give 1 star to its service as there is no option of zero,Installation experience very pathetic,B07HB7SSPZ
"This television is definitely a perfect balance between price and performance especially during flash sale at an exceptional price of ₹12500. Performance ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ----------------------- The processor in this Smart TV is powerful enough to play 4K 10bit HEVC videos right out of the box. VLC or MX player can be installed for enhanced media support. Picture Quality ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ -------------------------- Many people complain about the overbright screen. But it can be compensated by adjusting the display settings. These are my preferred settings. Backlight :1 to 20 ********************* During night even the lowest value of 1 is bright enough and can watch content without hurting eyes. During day time adjust it as per your requirement depending on your ambient lighting conditions. A maximum of 20 would be enough. Setting backlight to minimum improves black levels, reduces power consumption, increases LED life and reduces eye strain especially during night. Brightness :48 ***************** Brightness setting controls black level. Increasing brightness reduces black levels and hence reduces contrast. Brightness at 50, pictures looks washed out with poor blacks and color saturation At 45 black looks deep but lots of details at dark areas are lost while watching movies. 48 is an optimal setting to my eyes with good blacks and not so lack of details. Contrast : 40 to 45 ********************* Contrast setting controls white level. Contrast can be set anywhere between 40 and 45. Increasing contrast too much may cause highlight areas in a picture, like bright skies or shiny objects might look overexposed. As the screen itself is very bright, increasing contrast further makes whites look over bright. Also colors gets washed out while increasing contrast. Saturation: 45 to 50 ************************ Color saturation can be set anywhere between 45 to 50. At 45 colors look more natural. At 50 colors looks a bit punchy. But still its a personal preference. At the above settings, the black levels and colors were pleasing while watching demo videos of OLED TVs on YouTube at 1080p . The following Youtube videos help you to check the black level quality of the TV. LG 4K OLED Beauty Of Black Demo LG OLED Eclipse 2 Demo LG HD Demo Art Nouveau Full HD and 4K videos looks sharp in this TV. Downloaded a sample 4K HEVC video named 'Life Untouched' and also a 4K HEVC sample of the movie Elysium. Both of them played smoothly on the TV with very good details. Screen Quality ⭐⭐⭐⭐ -------------------------- I think this is a VA panel , the quality of which sits right in between TN and IPS panels. The screen is glossy and hence reflective. This might be a problem if the TV is placed in a room with windows facing it. Like all other LCD panels, this also has also got uneven screen uniformity but that's only noticed in plain dark grey backgrounds. While watching movies or other content it's not at all a problem. Screen non uniformity is a common issue even with high end TVs of big brands like LG Samsung etc. Luckily there's no backlight bleeding in the unit I received. Viewing angles are average with some loss of contrast even at low angles but that's a common VA panel characteristic. IPS panels with good viewing angles can't be expected at this price point. All LCD panel technologies have their strengths and weaknesses. IPS panels have good viewing angles but has poor black levels. VA panels excels in black depth despite it's average viewing angles and this TV has got very impressive black levels. Sound Quality ⭐⭐⭐⭐ -------------------------- Here the TV falters a bit. Bass is a bit weak but is very loud even at low volume. Midrange and treble are very good. Even minute high pitched click and tick sounds in movies can be heard very clearly. Edit: In a previous review I have mentioned these EQ settings sounds good. But it isn't. 100Hz : 7 300Hz : 8 1000Hz : 4 3500 Hz : 6 10000 Hz : 5 A high value of 8 for 300 Hz actually make the sound muddy and muffled. The following settings sounds much better and here's the reason. 100 Hz : 8 - Bass Frequency setting for deep bass male vocals and instruments like Kick Drum,Toms, Snare etc. 300 Hz : 4 - Low Midrange Enhances bass and depth of male vocals. Increasing 300Hz too much makes sounds muddy and muffled reducing clarity of high frequency sounds 1000 Hz : 3 - Midrange Imparts a metallic tone. Increasing makes sound tinny and unpleasant. 3500 Hz : 5 - Upper Midrange Vocals especially female sounds best at this frequency. A value of 5 enhances vocal quality. Increasing too much makes vocals harsh. 10000 Hz : 7 -Treble Adds crispiness and sparkle to vocals and instruments. Enhances tinkling sounds of metallic instruments. Human ear is sensitive to midrange and upper midrange frequencies Here it's 1000 and 3500 Hz. Setting these values too high can cause listening fatigue. Even increasing 300Hz is disturbing. Great sound performance especially bass is not even expected from a television in this budget. But considering its midrange frequency, clear treble and loudness, it deserves 4 stars. Remote Control ⭐⭐⭐⭐ ----------------------------- Minimalism is great. But minimalism with less functionality is not so great. Addition of Mute,TV Settings and Video input selection buttons would 've made the remote more functional. App support ⭐⭐⭐⭐ ----------------------- Many are complaining about lack of Netflix and Amazon prime on this TV. Xiaomi says they are working with Netflix to soon make it available. When they're done with it ,Netflix issue will be solved. I really don't care about Netflix. What that matters to me is movie playback capabilities of various formats and it does an excellent job with the support for media player apps like VLC and MX player. An excellent processor with HEVC hardware acceleration makes it a perfect multimedia platform. 4 stars for now and 5 stars when Netflix arrives. Pros and Cons --------------------------- Pros: 1. Powerful processor for 4K media playback. 2. App installation via USB 3. Built in Chromecast 4. Bluetooth remote 5. Voice Command Cons: (Update) Previously the main issues with the TV were the lack of Autoplay function and Standby option. But in the latest update both these issues are solved. Now when the TV is turned on it will automatically go to the previous Input source To enable it, go to Settngs >Inputs > Enable 'Stay on the previous source' option. Screen off feature is also added in the new update. Long pressing Power button will show Screen Off option. Now the TV is much better and the only one con according to me is the lack of miracast. 1. Miracast is missing. Only Chromecast is available, which works only for some specific apps. Google home app has to be installed on the phone for full fledged mirroring. Miracast is a versatile mirroring protocol that can mirror anything on the phone and doesn't need an app like Google Home to work. To sum up: -------------------- Overall considering the picture quality, powerful hardware and the price, the TV definitely deserve 5 stars devoid of it's average audio quality and the glossy screen because there are no other TVs in market with such features at this price point. Judging this TV just because of lack of Netflix isn't fair. Also Xiaomi now has got very strong service support across India. New brands like iFFalcon, Blaupunkt ,Thomson etc might provide better options at a competitive price. But when it comes to service centres, it's a dead end. I am very much satisfied with the purchase.",Priceworthy.,B07HB7SSPZ
"Value for money. Google play store , youtube etc. works fine. Side loaded apps works fine except a few Picture quality is great. Sound is however not awesome. Got it for 13.5 thousand thanks to Amazon offers. Delivery and installation both were great.",Worth the price.,B07HB7SSPZ
"Good quality for the price as i got it for 12-13k . Its an hd ready tv not full hd but still plays 4k and 1080p videos in satisfactory manner. Good sound quality. One star less for not having netflix and amazon prime which is essentially required anywhere now. Edit in Oct 2019 : Netflix and Prime added in the latest update , both working fine After a year of use tv still great also sound quality great. Changing my 4 stars to 5 stars. :-)",Good product for the price,B07HB7SSPZ
"First of all 1 star for delivery. Paid extra amount for next day delivery but product delivered after 2 days. (Tip: Don't pay extra for fast delivery option specially on Great Indian Festival) For installation and demo 5 star. Coming to TV, TV is smart with android os but display is average. Display- 3/5 Sound- 4/5 Display looks more brighter. There are no options to change colour settings, only brightness and contrast can be changed. Looking for smart tv around 14k then look for it. But have extra budget and want better display go for other options. Will update about smart features after few days of use. Thank you",Smart TV with average display,B07HB7SSPZ
"MI has claimed Indian market on the mobile category though I don't own one, but my friends and relatives experience has been great. With that in mind, I bought this TV. Pros: 1 )Slim design and Bezels maintained as much as possible to the edge, weighs barely 4 kg. 2) Multiple ports including Ethernet, HDMI, USB, wifi, Built in chrome cast, Always connected to my broadband. 3) Audio quality is good with DTS-HD, Android Oreo UI is great and it's fast as well. 4) TV quality is good, if you have HD DTH that would be great, no problem with viewing angles. 5) Smart TV UI has various customization options, I also installed some apps that provide Free shows, movies, like Hotstar, Jio TV, Jio cinema, Movies HD. Some of these have many inventory of free HD movies and shows and ofcourse YouTube. Also you can update apps to get the latest changes. Really worth it. 6) MI patchwall is awesome, it's similar to Hotstar with many freebies including Erosnow, Jio cinema, Hooq and Epic. 7) Bluetooth remote with Google assistant works like a charm also Built in Chromecast also works fast with phones. 8) TV stand that came with it is strong and strudy, still I mounted it on wall, not through them, I bought a Swivel mount so that I can swing it to side to side when required. Overall I don't think why no one will buy this for such a steal! Cons: The only con I found worthy of posting is this. 1) Prime video support. It's amazing or unbelievable! I'm buying this from Amazon through prime, yet they haven't partnered with MI ! Prime video app fails in this TV! Why Amazon? I think MI and Amazon should work it out for prime video support. I'm currently watching prime via a workaround. I downloaded chrome and logging in prime via Mouse attached to USB, like PC and watching it. PS: As I said before in the cons, I read that they will plan to put an OTA update for prime video soon. Those who are bashing this TV, expect an OLED TV quality from 14-15k! And probably should check their phone networks (WiFi and data) before chromecasting. I didn't have any problem.",Value for Money( Honest Review),B07HB7SSPZ
My overall experience till now I awesome.. it's best for low budget and now we get Netflix and Amazon Prime working after update. I am playing with my PS4 slim on it.

Screen mirroring working fine can watch Airtel TV with that. 5. USB support is working grate. Cons : 1. Hotspot is not a good option may work slow. It happen with me I have OnePlus 3T I connect it to my hotspot both Jio and Airtel none of them works.. anyway I took internet connection from local cable. 2. Have limited app in playstore.,Superb.

"This time Amazon took long to deliver my product as there was durga puja holidays. Item reached my nearest hub very fast. But from there it took 4 days to reach at my home. Now I will enter into my main review. I opened the package myself. There was free table top installation but I was so much excited and hence I unbox and installed myself. I was really worried about the quality of the TV as well as the picture quality. After turning on the tv when the display appears and I saw the entire display is intact then I feel myself safe. Automatic android and app finalizing will be done. Just you have to provide the google account details. It will take not more than 10 mins. Now coming to the picture quality. I am using a normal set top box of siti cable. So I really didn't check the quality with that. The picture is so brighter. I adjusted manually. And when I lowered all the paremeters, found very eye soothing. Colour quality is very good. I have a samsung full hd tv. And this is a HD ready tv. I found this mi tv's colour is very soothing and eye relaxing. Then I checked with HD video in youtube. I really amazed with the display quality. This TV really gives a masterstroke playing the HD videos. I feel this HD ready TV's picture quality is more fine than my samsung full hd tv. Every time I spoke to the remote and it understand my every word. And play automatically. You need a good wifi connection otherwise google will delay to listen your words. I will not give full marks for the sound quality. The voice quality is very nice. But bass is very low. But it is nice and loud. I really recommend the TV to everyone who are not a brand lover. Just have a try. No doubt you will be feel amazed. I got panicked viewing some negative reviews. I don't know with which tv they are comparing. But with respect to a hd ready tv it is a must buy cheapest all rounder tv.",A must buy cheapest all rounder tv,B07HB7SSPZ
Display is worst and coming dull and color is being bleeding. Not at worth for price and i recommend to go for another brand,Amazon and MI are cheating customers with TCL manufactured TV,B07HB7SSPZ
"The so called Mi Android TV.. I have been waiting for this product for quite a some time and at last here I am writing this review.. So you get pre installated apps like hotstar, Google play store etc.. but If you want to use Amazon prime and Netflix you need to side load these apps.. Amazon prime works fine but Netflix doesn't. The picture quality is good and the viewing angles are also nice. I had only one issue with this TV the screen mirroring is not working fine. I tried to cast few photos onto the TV but it gets stuck.. There is some issue with the inbuilt chrome cast I guess because the Google photos app is also very glicthy I was not able to cast the photos. I hope MI comes up with a fix for this in the next update. Apart from this issue you don't see any problems with the TV.",Awesome TV at this price range.. but..,B07HB7SSPZ
"1) Netflix doesn't work, app gets installed but gives some error on playing. Even casting netflix from your phone doesn't work. 2) No support for Amazon prime app via google play store. 3) Picture quality is very bad, even my parents who don't know much about TVs don't like its picture quality, I had to disable the adaptive brightness and keep the backlight at max to see some colours, otherwise the display seemed faded and dull. 4) Sound Quality is ok. 5) Installation service was prompt and timely done. 6) 400/- Rs. paid for wall mount, which is free with LG/Sony etc. 7) Manufacturing is done by TCL, its written on the box. MI is just rebranding it and selling. Overall waste of money, please but few thousand rupee more and go for standard brands like LG, Sony, Samsung, at least you will get good picture quality. MI compromised on the most important aspect of TV i.e. the display.","Bad picture quality, no netflix or amazon prime support",B07HB7SSPZ
"1)After 10 days, Google assistant not responding (Remote Google assistant button) even though you're connected to internet 2) Picture quality not good when you use Cable and Non HD plans 3)We cannot download all the apps from Google play.There are limitations 4) Google cast not good. When you play a movie through Google cast or mirror cast , There is a lot of lagging. 5)If you have mounted your TV on wall, it is difficult to connect a USB or any another devices.For that you have to buy a extension cable. 6)you cannot change the TV channels through the TV remote.You have to buy IR cable to make it functional(for DTH ). 7) Out of 8 gb you will get 3 to 4gb internal memory 8)Table mount stands are not good 9)For wall mount you have to pay 400 rupees extra",Google assistant in the remote not responding,B07HB7SSPZ
"Netflix , Hoichoi ,Amazon app not working. I have purchased the TV only to watch these. Tell me what should I do. I have no issue about anything else but if it's a Android TV then these app should run. Or else Mi should have informed that popular apps like Netflix won't get installed. Then I guess many wouldn't have purchased . Very negative approach",Popular apps like Netflix not getting installed,B07HB7SSPZ

its a failed product! there is no Pros except sound quality. Tons of Cons: 1. Low picture quality 2. Viewing angle worst 3. No Default input option 4. 3.5 mm Audio jack wont support for Home theatre even with full sound you will hear headphone level sound. 5. irritating no mute button on remote. 6. No button for inputs... keep pressing that four side buttons and Ok button daily million times... if you like 7. Worst design... Over all I can say its FAILURE of MI....

The TV takes a lot problem in getting connected with our mobile I.e bluetooth. also the screen mirroring does not work. Picture quality is also not so good.While the installation of the TV the fellow man didn't explain us the settings and that made a problem . So I expect that you will look in this matter and solve these problems as soon as possible,Poor,B07HB7SSPZ
"Feature-rich television at reasonable cost. Great picture quality, sound quality, voice search, smart Bluetooth remote, screen mirroring, everything I found is perfect. In specification it is mentioned that this is a HD ready TV but I tried to run full HD 1080 px video from YouTube and it runs flawlessly, no lags. Guys you won't believe it how feature-rich this television is. Thanks to Xiaomi that we are experiencing the top technology at very reasonable cost which was not possible earlier when some other brands were selling their TV at 40-50K",Feature-rich television at reasonable cost,B07HB7SSPZ

Pros: 1- Lesser Price 2- Android Tv Cons: 1- Screen Bleeding Issue. 2- Dull colors 3- Sound is just average no bass and when you volume up more than 50% speaker randomly going up and down 4- Worst service & customer support 5- Google voice search button is a hit and miss have to press even 3 times sometime.,Worst Product to Buy,B07HB7SSPZ
"I got this TV for my brother, since my previous experience with Mi TV 4A was good and this TV has added Chromecast and in-built mic feature. Unluckily the TV started showing-up software issues. It restarts automatically in mid of watching. Reached-out to MI Service and the Service men who attended this said me that it's an existing bug and it will be fixed in next software update (and nothing they can do about it). It's been a month after this visit, still no updates and my issue remains same. I checked with my colleagues and they have also reported same restart issues which can't be resolved at all. BUY THIS and LIVE with SOFTWARE issue is the verdict here !",Software issues,B07HB7SSPZ
Netflix is not support by both MI android tv app and its inbuilt chrome cast. Highly disappointed with it. Called MI customer care and they said that it won’t support. This is very basic feature of any smart tv and should be declared before selling it.,Netflix is not supported,B07HB7SSPZ
"The TV is overall good but it lags a lot while playing movies & videos, the Internet connection is getting disconnected again and again. Picture quality is good Sound quality is good response time is slow due to 1GB ram. No in built Prime Video & Netflix.

Pathetic product and pathetic after sale service from the brand as well as from amazon. Doesn’t support even amazon prime and they are selling it. Can’t watch Netflix on it as well. The tv has apps which no one ever heard off. Sending legal notice to both for deficiency in service and harassment.,Legal notice for deficiency in service and harassment,B07HB7SSPZ
Picture quality is not top notch in 32 inch. Even for a HD ready the sharpness and contrast of the panel is on the low side. Still they miss Netflix and prime videos...

"TV doesn't run after few minutes of playing any video. wifi that gives a speed of 50 mbps drops to few kbps as soon as any video is put to play. all other machines do not have such issue that run on same wifi. Lan speed is static. Routers and Modems changed several times but nothing has worked. definitely something wrong with wifi software inside the tv. technicians who have visited have seen it themselves and taken the videos too. another technician also called me on phone. all seem to speak similar line, there is nothing wrong with the TV. bottom line- if there is nothing wrong, why does the TV not run?? it seems team is clueless and inefficient in resolving the issue. may i request you to change my tv if you can't find a solution. hope someone would revert back soon.",poor service line / tv doesn't play / technicians clueless,B07HB7SSPZ
"This is my one year review, worst kind of android TV which won't let me have netflix on there. I was excited abt the TV thinking I can watch Netflix and to my surprise, it won't allow netflix on the MI brand. Damn shame... after all Sony or other big brands are there cuz of a reason...unlike Mi which is new in the game with big aspirations to compete with big brands but sorry features and sorry support will have to use this No TV as an extension to my laptop. I just bought the fire stick 3 weeks back and the HDMI ports are giving me cracking sound for audio and picture breaking badly and I am just 10 days out of warranty and they wouldn't even cover servicing due to that plus doesn't have any grace period. It's just frustrating buying this trash TV which won't play Netflix or won't let me use fire stick or won't work properly. Please don't buy this TV cuz of the cheap price. and guess what cheap things have cheap quality and cheap feel to it.",Worst Smart TV you can ever BUY,B07HB7SSPZ

"TV is good at this price range. Picture quality is good for hd videos. Audio is loud but quality is average. Wifi is slow. Mirroring is problematic but sometimes works ok. Lastly, delivery service of amazon is very bad. 1 star for that. Ordered on 9th and TV was delivered on 20th. The irony is that distance between warehouse and my home is only 250 kms. MI installation service is prompt. Installation request was placed in the evening and the installation guy came next morning. Overall average TV.",Average quality TV with worst delivery service of amazon,B07HB7SSPZ
Very bad experience regarding installation. Product was delivered well before the ETA. But very bad support on installation. Still could not check on the product since installation is pending. Scheduled date was on 3rd November but still waiting for technician visit. Not satisfied with MI customer support also. Thinking of returning the product if installation is not done by tomorrow.

"First of all, Amazon delivery and installation were very reliable and up to the mark. Installation person was very good. Coming to the television itself. The picture quality is so bad, I mean the display not so bright whereas the description says it's ultra bright and stuff. Display is totally disappointing. Also I see slight white cloudy tint on display. The sound is also not at all clear, while watching a movie you won't be able to figure out the dialogues without a subtitle on it. Poor sound. The build of the TV is also not so good. The outer frame if you press it, you will dear breaking it. Now coming back to Amazon, it's not even ten days and I'm trying to place a return request. Amazon says I can't return the product because it is not in their policy. I don't understand that, I really thought if the product description doesn't match the actual product then Amazon would take back the product. But no! They won't.

"You all must have read the reviews regarding specs, performance etc. My review is based on view point of a normal user, even more so from a user who has just upgraded from CRT. Put on HD subscription (DTH or cable) and then you will see the picture quality. It's awesome. The 32 inch HD ready model is an ideal size for HD channels as they generally are 720p. You can see the attached pictures for estimating picture quality, the second one is from YouTube at 720p. From the experience I had at Xiaomi Service Center with my phone, I can gladly tell you can trust it's service. After the update, the sound quality is subtly improved. The best thing about this is, you can even cast your laptop using chrome, I don't think others provide this application. Amazon Prime is soon to be supported and Netflix isn't. I can live with that. Don't worry if you don't find any music apps in play store. Just tell Google assistant what you wanna play and it will play in whatever app you want, be it gaana, Saavn or wynk. So yeah, no complaints so far. I would advice you to use a stabilizer IF you are using government's electricity service. And yes, don't book your installation on Sunday even if it shows it's available, they are not. To those who are saying you can't make AV or any of the HDMI as default. Go to APPS - Live TV, add this to favorites, so you can directly access cable from interface. Now in Patchwall whichever mode you will select, will be set as default when you open Live TV app from interface, there you go! Go for it!",Just don't judge it!,B07HB7SSPZ
"Pros: - The TV looks good. Has a nice aesthetic appeal. - Picture quality is good. I bought the 32 inch HD Ready one. It's not entirely HD, but you can play HD stuff on it. - The Patchwall OS has received a nice upgrade from the previous one. So the content is more manageable and fluid. - The voice assistant feature is a nice edition to the remote. Not very fast, but still a nice feature to have! - Built-in Chromecast, so you can directly stream content from you device which is also pretty neat! (With some limitations) - Accessible PlayStore with a large variety of apps available directly(Some limitations) Cons: - As you must have heard, there's not Netflix or Prime default support. You have go through a little manual process to get them working. Even then you can't use Netflix without a mouse and a keyboard(A later update has solved this keyboard issue, yet to test) - You do have access to the Google PlayStore, but some important apps are restricted. So it's a feature, but not entirely useful. - The built-in chromecast also doesn't allow you to stream Netflix or Prime content. You have to download them seperately (sideload) - The assistant doesn't work if you attach headphones to the TV, so just a warning to anyone who uses it that way. - Sound quality is not that great. There's very limited bass. Although the sound is quite high, it doesn't have a nice quality to it. It sounds flat sometimes Overall, A decent TV with nice picture quality. Built-in chromecast within a good budget. Can access blocked apps through sideloading. So only purchase it if you're ok making changes to the tv and installing apps from outside sources",Decent TV.,B07HB7SSPZ
"First of all I was too excited about MI TV. Installation was done after 15 days of delivery because of irresponsible engineer who wrongly mentioned installed status. When it comes to quality picture quality is ok. Sound quality is not great. Build material is so cheap. Most important thing is that it's Android TV with lots of software bugs. 1) WiFi is not working properly even after installation of latest firmware. 2) Bluetooth connection with any speaker is too tough. TV is spending time in finding device. Paired device is not automatically connected via Bluetooth. 3) You can not install Netflix, Amazon Prime and many other apps directly. You need to install it via other sources. And installed apps not visible anywhere. 4) TV gets hanged many times.",TV with lots of Software bugs,B07HB7SSPZ

Plzz i request to refund/replace my tv My frnd also have same issue with this tv after 6 months and he got replacement of tv,Very bad experience,B07HB7SSPZ
I purchased this product on 18 Oct within a month I started having lot of tech problems. The operating system keeps crashing. In the middle of watching something it happened a lot of times now lost count. Have to reset it whenever the OS crashes. After the technician resets the problem reoccurs again. The MI service has just informed me that replacement is not available after first 10 days. Which is not a good thing. The problem here is a technical issue of system crash but still they dont have a replacement of TV. It's waste if the system crashes you cannot use it for any purpose. Also had a trouble with the remote which runs on Bluetooth pairing which dysfunctioned too soon within six months of purchase. Also there is no Amazon prime or Netflix support cannot download from the play store as well. I watch only hotstar and YouTube on TV The Netflix cannot be directed casted from the app on this TV also. You can only chrome cast I.e Tab cast but the picture quality is horrible and black looks purple on TV after casting. If the OS crashes this TV cannot be used for anything and is a total waste of money and time. DONT BY THIS PRODUCT UNLESS THERE IS A GOOD GUARANTEE OR WARRANTY OPTION FOR REPLACEMENT OF FAULTY PRODUCT LIKE I GOT,Too many tech issues system crash and not so smart TV,B07HB7SSPZ
"The price point tipped my buying decision in its favour. Pros: Dimensions & Weight - Compared to my previous TV, this is much lighter and thin bezels Connectivity - 2 USB, 3 HDMI, AV Cons: HD Ready & not Full HD Android is quite buggy, Google Assistant stopped working on day 2 No Netflix, No Prime Video - I had to use an Apple TV box to get access to these apps MIUI Tieup content needs separate logins/signup/payment Disappointing pre loaded software - No chrome etc Overall - I am not sure if it was a wise buy except the price point",Budget Buy,B07HB7SSPZ

"Hi, I am a big fan of Xiomi products. They always worked perfactly. But i am not happy with my recent purchase of Mi 4C pro TV. The TV is good but there is so much to improve in software part. 1. There is no auto AV select on boot option. There are older members in our family and they are not able to handle new OS like interface and they just want to watch good old Set Top Box Channels. It was a simple option in previous version of MI TV 4A so why it is not available in this one? Temporary Solution :- You can select Live TV app in TV and set it as the first app in home screen. So whenever you tv starts it will be the first app selected by default and by pressing select (big middle round button) Set Top Box will start. 2. There is no instant TV on option. It is available in other same category android tv. After shutting down we have to wait for the whole OS to load again. 3. I bought MI IR cable and it is detected by Live TV Guide app in main screen but whenever i select a channel it says the cable is not connected. I have tried resetting the TV and still not working. It was working fine in previous tv why is it not working in this one. Please help. 3. Why can't i use the built in bluetooth as a regular normal bluetooth like sending files and more. When android is available there in tv and we are paying for it why not let us use it at its full potential. 4. It's a android TV and no time is displayed on home screen. I have always liked Mi for its full support for the customers. I hope they will come up with solutions and release an update as soon as possible.","MI 4 C Pro - Good TV, Bad Software",B07HB7SSPZ
"I got this LED Tv at Rs13499 at first sale, i like the features below is the some Pros and Cons Pros: Built in google apps including playstore so you can download any app you want very easily. Built in Chromecast which is a very great feature, i love this It has both android and patchwall. so you can feel the customized features that Mi has put in patchwall. 8 GB internal memory out of with you will get 4.2GB for your use remaining is already occupied by android system. It supports Bluetooth which will help you to connect your Bluetooth speaker, Keyboard, mouse, headphone etc. It also has google voice assistant so senior members of family would easily operate it. Remote is Bluetooth connected. Cons: Default color settings are little fade but i customized it from settings. They don't give wall mount and remote batteries in the pack so you'll have to spend more than 400 above the base price of LED. I felt LED stand is not that good. It was of cheap quality though i didn't used it as i mounted LED on the wall.

"Really a value for money product. I had to buy this after my age old CRT tv broke down beyond repairs. Got only 500 for it under exchange. The only problem I faced in first 3 months was the issue in connecting to home wifi, it used to take many minutes & multiple attempts to get it connected to wifi. But after a software update in January 2019, it started working well & now connects to home wifi quickly. The picture quality is quite good, looking at the price point of about 12k, bought it in Oct 2018. It connects & remains paired with my JBL Flip 3 bluetooth speaker easily. Streaming from my Samsung, Redmi & Lenovo mobiles is also easy over wifi. Voice recognition also works well. Very limited number of apps are enabled for android TV, however, you can also install additional apps using APK files from USB. Ok for browsing the Internet - had to download Puffin Browser. It takes sometime to get used to the quite hard remote buttons. Remote is very slim & sleek. As the remote is Bluetooth enabled, no need to point it directly to TV. I wish there was a direct setting to open/start the DTH/Cable input by default, as it is quite difficult to operate for elders in the family, as they don't know the remote navigation functions. I read someone complaining about not being able to install and run apps like Amazon Prime & Netflix on this TV. Please note that it is Amazon & Netflix's decision to not support this Android TV. Hence don't blame Xiaomi for this issue. It is due to the corporate fight between Google vs Amazon & Netflix. And has nothing to do with the capabilities of this TV.","I thought of giving 4 stars but after recent software update, changed it to 5 stars",B07HB7SSPZ

"well i got the TV today intact, loved the packaging, no harm done to the hardware. now coming to the installation, contacted the store through the link in the mail i received for installation, the guy was polite, did in 10 minutes and left (no charges). in the box, there was one remote, one tv, table top stand and the ac adapter, although i thought the delivery man will give the AAA batteries for the remote but nevermind, thats hardly an issue to consider. the audio quality is great for a 11k TV with android OS as its base. I read reviews about how netflix nd prime was not deployed. So, as soon as i started the TV, i ran a update check nd found the update of Android 9. the TV came with version 8. in the new version, it eas clearly stated that its now supporting the netflix and lrime officially. the update was of 825 mb. after the update the netflix was preinstalled nd prime was easy to install through play store. both are running seamlessly. coming to casting, yes it is possible through google home app, and if ur phone is having inbuilt casting mechanism then too no problem at all. i casted my phone nd it worked like a charm. video quality is great. i ran 720p, 1080p nd 4k, and it was running without any stutter or lag. the customization is pretty great. the UI is catchy and easy to understand nd use. The voice recognition feature works well, although you need the internet connection to make it work for anything. what i think is Xiaomi should at least enable the recognition system for basic local tv functions. I meant that yes i can turn the volume up nd down, change channels by speaking, but that too requires an internet connection. please resolve this. also, there is no mute function on Mi tv remote. i know its hard to change the hardware but u can give an update where we can press or hold a certain button to mute and unmute. most of the content to watch is free and yes its categorized in a great way. the table top atand is sturdy. the look is sleek and classy. loved the product. great job Mi. and please take the two things i mentioned into consideration in ur next update, the mute thing and the localization of voice assistant for basic rv functions. and to the negative reviewers, if u r asking for a smart tv, then at least be smart to explore everything from start to end, then place ur conclusions, nothing would be spoon feeded to u guys. thanks. have a great day.",Update before posting baseless reviews,B07HB7SSPZ

Product built quality is so poor, sometimes my TV auto reboot my family members always complaining me for this TV.

"Remote has less than basic features. Old TVs had basic buttons and limited functions so could do most of the tasks from TV buttons as well but still those TVs also had lot of buttons on remote whereas smart TV has lot of features and remote is the only tool you have to control it. MI remote doesn't have Mute button so forget about other functions. Oh and it takes ages typing with this remote. You better buy 2in1 remote online which has both touch and keyboard features. Really, you will have to spend lot of time to do normal things with this TV and remote. There are 2 modes to access channels/apps. TV interface is hard to manage, you can customize little bit on app interface but it is almost impossible to make the changes in Patchwall. I tried watching videos but that does not help. You are stuck with the random serials/movies/channels on tabs on Patchwall. I'm using wi-fi with good speed so streaming was ok but TV LAGS SEVERAL TIMES, you have to clear cache and everything. Voice assistant response is also SLOW now. You can boost and clear cache from inbuilt TV manager app but still I'm not happy, you can take a chance. Display is nice, no complaints about that. Sound is also good for this price. To conclude, I will say go with branded TVs like Sony, etc. They will cost more but trust me it is worth it.

"I bought this as a second TV for my bedroom and now I am repenting why I did not buy bigger size TV. Got it as an exchange for my 10 year old LG TV and with credit card discount at 11k. Pros : 1. Patch wall , although has old collection, is a clear differentiator compared to other 32 inch non smart TVs from LG, Samsung and Sony. It has lot of regional content and is improving. Agreed that it is SDish ; but still is good. My old fire TV stick works with the only exception that for Netflix, audio needs to be set back to stereo as 5.1 output does not work. 2. Inspite of being just HD ready, HD content looks good (but not as great as my old LG HD ready) Cons: 1. Sound is loud but audio clarity is not good. Looks like outpur is bass heavy which makes the dialogues less clear at high volume. 2. Not rugged like LG and Sony. Handle with care if you plan to shift homes. Very delicate. 3. 32 inch looks puny. Go for 43 and Full HD. 4. No Alexa integration. Being an android TV, it is easy to give this feature.",More Value for the 💰 with Regional content.,B07HB7SSPZ

"Totally a waste products plz don't go for this product I am regretting after purchasing this Mi TV. Reasons : 1. No net flix & amazon prime video. 2. Zero functionality on remote, you always have to go setting manually & change the picture quality or sound quality If you want to, you can't change those in middle of your show or movie you have to totally go back & change the settings. 3. No button functionality on TV, so this means if your remote is lost you can't see the TV until you find your remote. 4.

Since Chromecast is not working you won't be able mirror an app from mobile as well, will feel cheated and helpless thinking I should have bought a Rs 10,000 worth LED TV and a Amazon firestick.",Screen Casting is not working for everyone,B07HB7SSPZ
Totaly TV is not all worthy to buy to watch Amazon prime and Netflix. It doesn't support both of these apps. So my request is not to go for it if you are a lover of amazon prime and Netflix. So I made a call to Amazon customer service team they had told to update the software. Even after update also I couldn't be able to see any of them.,Worst TV. Bad experience.,B07HB7SSPZ
This TV is not working from day one properly .I put a complete to mi more then twice....but still thay are not giving me a best solution...the agent or engeniar of mi said everytime different issues..now he said the motherboard is not working and he'll open upfront of us ...and he said you purchased this product from Amazon that's why you are in trouble..if you pursued from mi showroom the we'll definitely replace this product now we can't replace...so now I am little worried what should I do..is I done any mistakes to deal with Amazon or Amazon will really help me to get the replacement of this product...I am very disappointed ....,Bad product,B07HB7SSPZ

"I am writing this review after using this tv for 10 days. Overall by looking at price of 14K (1000 rs was off during great Indian sell) tv is very good. Pros 1) remote is very handy and easy to use voice search feature is hassle free. 2) Good in speed and Bluetooth connectivity I connected my Bluetooth speakers, headphones and it's working fine. Cons 1) Viewing angle I can be improved. 2) Amazon prime not able to install same for Netflix. (May be there can other way or MI will update in any upcoming fix).","Good budget ""Andrid"" TV",B07HB7SSPZ
"It is really a great product with good picture and sound quality. Mine one is of 2019 model and comes with 3 star marking instead of 4 star. Mi TV team require to provide software update to eliminate initial some bugs. Be aware, everytime when you switch on the TV you have to select input source like AV or HDMI which is a real problem for old age people. Mi TV team please do the needful to solve the issues otherwise you may lose your market share on this particular model. Buyer can go with this product blindly because of its price tag and quality. Some user complaining about Chromecast etc but I believe mi TV team aware of that through the users feedback and they will definitely provide an update to solve those issues soon. Thanks. Revision on 04.02.2019 Software update received OTA and issues resolved. You can now buy it without any hiccups. Great job mi TV team. Applause. Finally revising the star marking to 5 from 4.",Great product,B07HB7SSPZ
"I was using Mi Led TV 4A from last 6-7 months. I bought this Mi led TV 4C Pro one week ago. Talk about build quality it's made by plastic & good enough at this price point. It's light weight & design is almost similar to Mi LED TV 4A. Picture quality is not the very best but it's good. Resolution is 1366×768 means it is only a HD ready panel. I checked on tv upto 4k videos on YouTube & full hd videos on USB drive was playing smoothly but after 720p no major difference in quality of video on higher resolution. I feel little bit better quality display in comparison of Mi LED TV 4A. One thing to notice on display that corners are little but darker when your screen is white. Overall picture quality is acceptable. Sound output is almost same as Mi Led TV 4A. It comes with 10w×2 two speakers setup & it is loud & clear upto 70% volume. I feel little bit distortion on high volume but I say it is one the best the sound output in TVs in this price segment. Now talk software/os it runs on Android 8.1 & Patchwall. Android gives you freedom to download tons of apps from play store which is already available on tv. You can set up your android smartphone with tv. Share your smartphone content to tv easily through Google cast because it comes with Chromecast built in. Youtube works flawlessly if internet speed is good. Patchwall gives lots of content from many online content partners some are free and some paid but it's good. Tv comes with lots of connectivity features. Here is 3×HDMI, 2×USB, AV, 3.5mm audio out, lan port, Bluetooth & wifi. Tv comes with a bluetooth enabled 12 button voice remote which is very useful you can use is from any direction & use voice command from dedicated mic available on remote. Table mount comes in box but you need to pay 399 for wall mount installation. Overall it is a value for money Smart LED Android TV by Xiaomi.",Pocket friendly Android TV by Xiaomi,B07HB7SSPZ
"Too good product at a steal! I can't really believe this 23"" Smart HD LED TV came for only 12K. Picture quality excellent Sound Quality and clarity excellent User friendly interface, even the elderly members of our family have learnt to switch between cable TV and Wifi streaming quite easily and quickly. And the beat part is the voice enabled remote control. It's voice recognition is really accurate inspite of Indian accent, and results from voice activated Google Search has brought about a mini revolution in the way we watch TV.",Super duper value for money Thanks to Amazon.,B07HB7SSPZ
"First impressions: Great smart device but low picture quality so can't call it a smart TV can call it a smart device Update: After 5 days of usage Thought it is a great smart device But after usage a few days found many problems namely 1. WiFi needs to be conected manually Everytime you switch on the tv Intially thought WiFi wasn't in range and I have purchased range extender as tv showing low signal strength and the router getting constantly disconnected even though WiFi router was in the adjacent room with only one wall in-between When I was setting up the range extender I found strength of WiFi signal at the tv is 80% later checked with the mobile and laptop and confirmed it. As anyway I have purchased the range extender, went ahead and installed it just beside tv. Now tv doesn't get disconnected in the middle but I have to manually connect to WiFi every time I switch on the tv. Implies poor WiFi antenna in TV 2.its not a smart device we need a teche to install apps and make tv smart 3. PATCHWALL worst thing I have ever seen It doesn't have any content it its own. It is the app which shows the content of various apps such as ZEE5, voot, hungama play, sunNXT, H&Q, EROS NOW, EPIC ON, ... To view content each of these apps need to be individually installed and have individual subscription as normal user of the apps with no additional discount, on top of it we can't access these apps natively on Android home nor install them there. Update Amazon prime and Netflix working Apps are installing outside patchwall Overall good after Android 9 update 3.5 star 4 is little optimistic",Low picture quality and not a smart device,B07HB7SSPZ
"Best SMART TV at lowest rate with almost most features. Pros: 1. Really smart. Lots of apps 2. Reads Hard disks without trouble. 3. Plays all .mkv files with x264 codecs. Sometimes Plays 1080p videos also seamlessly. 4. Has inbuilt apps like youtube,hotstar, etc., can download more from Play store. Cons: 1. A bit slow sometimes. have to switch off/on sometimes. 2. Mirroring is very slow. Only high end phones work smoothly. 3. Do not load more apps. 4. Volume is low for large rooms Verdict: If u want to enjoy the SMART TV features at a lower rate, this MI TV is the best choice. But if u need Real feature rich SMART TV, then go for other top brands like SONY, SAMSUNG.",Best Cost effective Feature rich TV!!!,B07HB7SSPZ
"Almost, 9 months now to use this tv. Video and audio quality is really good. It is 720 video, works fine with 1080p videos also in vlc player. Just con of tv is its PLAY STORE. when i purchased it, MI people said, that NETFLIX and AMAZON PRIME will come in January 2019 update, but its june 2019, still no app, not much apps on playstore, though u can use aptoide and air remote, to use amazon prime and netflix. You can google what aptoide is. If you are planning to purchase decent 32INCH android tv, this is the one in this price. Voice recognition works pretty fine for me. Almost all app support that feature. Just install aptoid in it, and its the best tv Just need official amazon and netflix app, these apps lags when downloaded from third party.",Best in price for android tv,B07HB7SSPZ
"I've bought this TV for 15k but now the price is reduced to 14k. For the price I paid, I'm completely satisfied with the product. Build quality of the TV feels fine for me as I should not expect much for the price I've paid. It's above average. The panel looks good, not the best one out there but it's good for the price, you won't get any better panel at this price point as of now. It supports videos upto 4k which is great thing in my opinion. The speakers on this TV are surprisingly loud but there is no bass at all. So, I would recommend you to connect some good external speakers to it for better sounding experience. If you're planning to use table stand on this TV then you have to increase the diameter of the holes on this TV by tightening and untightening the screws 3 or 4 times in each hole for perfect fit of the stands. I really like the Chromecast feature of this TV, and mainly it's an android TV. The reason that I'm mentioning it as an Android TV is that most of the other brands claim theirs as smart TVs but most of them won't run on android, they just install some multimedia apps and some other apps on the TV and advertise them as smart TVs. But this TV is a pure smart TV as it runs on android Oreo 8.1, I've received two OTA updates since the day I purchased it. If you're planning to buy this TV, I would suggest you to connect this TV to the internet as initial setup takes around 20 mins to go to the home screen. You can install prime video app on this TV too by downloading it from third party websites and installing it via USB. Overall, very satisfied with the product.",Best SMART TV (ANDROID) below 15k,B07HB7SSPZ

"This is a nice tv according to the price point. It's android so alot of apps although amazon prime and netflix is still not available and can only be accessed through side loading. Picture quality is good, colors are punchy and display is sharp with good amount of brightness, those who are having problem of low brightness turn off dynamic backlight and increase the amount of backlight from the settings, panel is enough bright but i have noticed that in the corners of the display there is vignetting although it not noticeable to your eyes while watching content but its there. Sound quality is fine don't expect some excellency of sound, it is your typical tv type sound and in terms of that tv type sound its fine, loud enough for a big room even on below 50% volume levels.

"Observations : - Booting the device takes similar time like booting a android smartphone. It's not plug and play like normal TV's. I myself have LG smart TV and good part about that is it boots up fast and plays the channel from DTH and loads the android festures later. We generally use TV for watching channels and not for browsing through various apps. Here even shutting down takes some time. - No channel selector buttons or mouse feature in remote like LG smart TV. In LG I can either use DTH remote or TV remote for changing channels , volume etc. But here once we swtich on the TV we have to take DTH remote to switch on DTH and change channel - Also once TV boots up, everytime we have to manually select setup box from the menu which is cumbersome process especially when you are gifting this product to elderly people. - The picture quality is average and when comparing with LG , picture is not that great. - Bluetooth feature of remote is quite good as we no longer need to show remote directly to the TV - OS is pretty good and is very fast unlike LG webos. Because the processor and RAM is higher than LG. Otherwise LG webOS has much more features. - TV is sleek and has more input and output ports -viewing angle is average - Screen mirroring is very laggy and causes strain to eye. LG webOS has upper hand here. - Google speech works very very well. It understands indian accent very well",Just about good .. and its cheap,B07HB7SSPZ
"it's just 3 months old, Multiple times it filed to reboot & always asking for the factory reset and when watching tv it is hanging like android mobile when the screencast at that time it stops and never responds . when there is a problem you have to go for the factory reset 99% of the time it is also not working and then you have to power off and on the TV. very bad experience.","Never buy , Stay away ,Very Bad Experience ,, Don't waste your money",B07HB7SSPZ
"As i said its a very basic LED smart tv. I initially thought i will buy this and use as a PC monitor, there are few points you need to note here. This is a basic LED smart tv/android tv. Pros: 1. Good smart features 2. It has built in Bluetooth (good for connecting bluetooth devices/headphones). 3. Display quality is fine, when using as a TV/youtube streamin on TV (as long as the contents are of good quality). 4. Worth for the price 12.4k . cons: 1. Bit of an average display quality (less pixel density) 2. Cant directly use this a an extended/main pc display, unless you have a good graphic card with HDMI (else pixel will fade). 3. it doesnt have the basic sound equalizer (may be its the MI version, it has db's and type of db's you can adjust, its too machine language). Not so user friendly. 4. Sound system/quality is very poor (really sad about it, my phone play good sound than this) . I am using external sound bar. Literally zero bass you get.

"MI has done a great job in marketing the fully featured Android TV which is originally manufactured by TCL. But the marketing and customer service after sales by MI provides assurance although this is a very affordabe low entry priced TV in Android market. The setup of this fully featured Android TV is simple and effective and the pre installed apps works flawlessly. Although the video playback through wifi and chromecast even in high speed network had some playback issues in downloaded apps which is negligible if u dont install too many apps. The best part of this MI TV is the remote which is simple and best for Internet TV users. Since its an Android based TV most people who buy this would essentially use more of the Internet content hence this remote which is simliar to Amazon Fire TV Stick is absolutely wonderful. The only thing that needs some improvement is the Sound quality. No doubt that the speakers are loud but the voice clarity is not that clear having used to the other TV brands which cost thrice as much as this MI Android TV. For a start to start using Android fearures in a TV that too in this price segment its easily the best Android TV in the market current if u are willing to spend some money on a quality sound bar for better quality sound. Bought it at a price of Rs. 12,499 without the instant discount on card payment. But if Rs. 1500 is reduced the price of Rs. 10,999 is an absoutele delight for every person who decides to but this TV with all those interesting features provided which works best as promised.

"MI TV 4C PRO is not Compatible with Dish NXT HD Set Top Box. If you select HDMI input for viewing TV channels, you will not get any Video Output, only Audio will be there. After facing the problem for first time, I thought there is problem in the HDMI cable. I changed that, but the problem remains. Next I called dish tv care, the service engineer tried all settings, finally decided to change the set top box. It was within warranty period, so one new Dish NXT HD box was given. And the same problem arises, only audio out put. That time I was sure that something is wrong with my TV. I contacted MI Care. Service Engineer told me they will change the TV internal board, because USB ports are connected to the board. And finally he changed the TV board. With the new board installed I switched on the TV, selected the HDMI TV input, and surprised, NO Video,only audio. That time the mechanic called another mi technician, he replied this problem is known, it is not compatible with Dish NXT HD set top box. He suggested me to go for any other DTH connection. I have no other option.",Do not buy MI TV 4C PRO if u have DISH NXT Set Top Box: read my story,B07HB7SSPZ
"Very good android tv at the price. No other option in market can beat this quality and features. Pros: Voice Recognition is too good to use Build Quality is very good Sound quality is good at this price and I'm surprised by this Certified Android TV Navigation is easy with remote provided, even remote control is quite good and very simple and clutter free Connectivity is very easy and fast Enough HDMI/USB slots Cons: Hangs a lot when using any installed app Too slow to respond at times, 1GB Ram is not enough. Think of future say after 4-5 years this TV won't even turn-on with this configuration. Patchwall is of no use and all the content either paid or unwatchable. Let buyers decide whether they want amazon prime, netfix, zee5, hungama whatever they can install. Don't bloat. I request Xiaomi to remove the patchwall to make some space and reduce lag. No wall mount stand provided. It's ok if Xiaomi doesn't provide wall mount in package but the wall mount installation guys provide is fixed and non movable. So its of no use. Al least they can provide option fot flexible wall mount. Picture quality is not that great with narrow viewing angles.

"Mixed experience! did a lot of research before finalising on this TV Reasons I went with this buy 1. Android TV is coming up (again) and TV market is fast evolving, spending 30-40k on a Sony/Samsung as a 5yr investment did not feel right, (this TV could be a temp investment and can upgrade in a couple of years when there are more clearer options) 2. Players like Vu, bpl, sanyo are known for their super bad after sales support; didn't want to take that risk considering MI is marginally better and promising a lot in the service front 3. Even as a standalone tv ignoring the 'smart' aspect, it still is decent value for money at 14k (after 1k cash back) 4. 1yr extended warranty is one more reason to buy now Pros 1. Good picture quality for hd ready (comparable to Sony hd ready) though longevity is a question 2. Speakers are good enough for a mid-sized living room 3. Looks good! 4. Seamless Google account integration Cons 1. Chromecast works only partially - not all apps that support Chromecast cast in this TV, example Netflix 2. Play Store is a joke - hardly 10 apps that are useful available right now and Netflix, Prime, Sony Liv are definitely not on the list Verdict - if you are ready to invest in fire stick (or if you are a fan of PatchWall) then this TV is a decent value for money. Hopefully more apps and features come onboard in this 'android tv'",Decent buy,B07HB7SSPZ

The TV overall is great. One can sideload apps. Switching on and Off takes its time. Bluetooth headphones can be connected which is a useful feature. Sound quality and picture quality is ok. Value for money. Android apps can be side loaded. Amazon messed up with the installation procedure. Sent me the contact details of the installation person who had quit the job 3 minths ago !

For sound quality I will say 3 stars...because bass effect is not great at all, I will suggest to buy home theater for good sound effects. One problem is that when you connect wireless keyboard and mouse adapter with TV the voice search is not working.....

Voice remote not working properly and lack of normal remote features for Live TV. Screen and Sound Quality average. Viewing Angle also bad. Our family having more than 5 Redmi brand phones.

It’s a semi smart TV I would say as it doesn’t have Netflix or prime video which are the main Features or a smart TV and the Android tv which is so much promoted - I feel u can’t download all apps so I would give it 1 star as I had bought the earlier version of this so called smart tv and this one too but it lacks majority of smartness which anyone would expect . Please check if the smart tv supports Netflix or amazon prime preloaded before buying any smart or android tv.,Not so Smart,B07HB7SSPZ
"Got it for as low as 9k during sales with discounts. The Amazon installation team didn't show up for 8 days after the TV was delivered. Thankfully we had an option where in we could book an Mi technician for the Mi app. Well I know even teenager can easily setup the TV but if you do it yourself it will void warranty and that is why you have to wait for there technician to arrive who by the way was very quick. Alright let's move to pros and Cons... Pros... 1. Value for money. 2. Looks great and is light weight. 3. It's got both Android as well as Patchwall. And with a strong WiFi connection you won't need Cable or Dish antenna connection any more. 4. For an average room the built in speakers are enough. 5. Patch wall has a lot of free content to offer and when connected to your Android phone there is whole lot of possible things that you can do, being able to play Pub g on medium settings is my favourite. 6. You can connect your pendrive to side load apps as well. 7. trick: Side load thopp TV app to watch paid content for free. 8. Voice command on Mi remote works as good as in any Android phone. Cons.. 1. While the speakers are loud and clear with Android TV apps and Patchwall it somehow seems muffled up with Cable connection. 2. Same applies with display. Normal SD connection cable picture quality is disappointing one needs an HD connection for better experience. 3. WiFi range isnt very powerful had to shift my Mi WiFi router from Bedroom to Hall for a steady connection.","Bang for Bugs, Read review for Pros and Cons",B07HB7SSPZ
So far so good. Delivered on time and installed on time by a very good professional who provided the full demo. About TV : It's worth the price ... I got it for 14k and it's working flawlessly since the day I received it. Suggestion to all is to go through the description and specifications first before buying this rather than buying and then blaming Mi or Amazon for not being upto your standards. They are selling exactly what has been specified. I am happy with what I have got. Plus both Netflix and Amazon Prime can be installed with a workaround easily and they work without hassle.,Worth the prize :),B07HB7SSPZ

"I have purchase MI LED 4C Pro 32 inches TV on 02nd Nov 2018, after using 6 month getting problem in TV (not getting start, as per service person PCB board need to be change), I have very disappointment for this product and specially MI company as it's a reputed company in indian market that's why I choose this product but finally I get bad product and I very disappointed from that type of issue. If MI product getting default in just 6 month, I don't know how long running this product. (only 1 year warranty) Hope MI concern person look in my review & get proper solution on that Very ridiculous customer service from MI, as on 11th day for raising complaints, not getting proper reply & solution by company. no any servicing person visit for checking issue. Customer care not getting proper reply regarding resolving complaint. Please all people who purchase MI TV thinking 100 times before take this....because better customer service is the key of best Company in market.",Worthless product..!!

Brough this for 10k in the sale if you are looking for tv under 12k this is the perfect one it has I'm personally using this as a monitor from few days it has 60hz refresh rate and 5ms delay I'll mention some pros and cons of this tv Pros Very budget friendly Has Netflix & Amazon Prime Has Bluetooth (Connected My Home Theatre Via Bluetooth) Has Good Color Saturation Cons It's 720p Been using it for gaming but the experience is not too good just because it is 720p For Big Room Like Hall 720p is not enough At last under 12k it is a good buy.,"Budget Friendly, Go For it if you get this for or lesser than 11k",B07HB7SSPZ
"Please don't buy this TV as this one lacks three basic things of smart TV. 1.This does not have the Amazon prime video and Netflix apps pre-installed. 2. Though this TV has Google Play you are not allowed(disabled ) to install amazon prime video and Netflix apps on your TV. 3. This TV not does have autoplay from hdmi / last source option. Which means everytime you open tv it will goto the android homepage and from there you need to select source and start dtv/ cable TV channels. Not at all suitable if you have elder people at home as they will struggle to start DTH channels everytime . Apart from this , some other not good things are that this take very long to start like windows around 2 mins like a computer and there is no Standby option which would have made starting tv faster but that's not possible in this TV.",Don't buy-This smart TV cannot play Amazon prime video and Netflix,B07HB7SSPZ
The screen is very dull as you can see in the picture I've posted. Picture quality is good but screen is not bright enough. No official Netflix app and netflix google/chrome cast doesn't work. Side loaded app works but needs a mouse. I've installed version 4.16.1 build 200147. It's an OK product but if you compare the price it's the best you can get.,Not that smart,B07HB7SSPZ
Pros: Decent buy for 15k. Typical android tv with all functions. Picture and sound seems to be pretty much good. Remote is more intelligent and casting facility brings the spirit. All apps just functions like an andriod device. 2 USB slots. Bluetooth facility. Cons: Picture clarity Issues while viewing from sides (color variance and quality issues). On/Off takes some time to operate (Typical android Shut down). Bluetooth connectivity is nit that great.,Value for Money,B07HB7SSPZ
"The Mi TV 4C is just EPIC for the price you pay but the thing is the PlayStore in the Mi TV doesn't have the main apps like Amazon Prime, Netflix and Jio TV These are the 3 mostly used apps but don't know why it doesn't have it Yes you can Side load the apps with the help of .apk files but the thing is it doesn't work like a natively supported app If Mi works towards this there is nothing that can come close to it",The TV is real good but doesn't support a few main apps natively,B07HB7SSPZ
"To start with there are thousands of reviews for the Mi TV, some good and some bad. My review is after using it for a week and I would rate the TV as Average. Like a 7 out of 10. Main reasons: 1. Display quality is average - the blacks are not purely black, the colour suffers a little. 2. WiFi - there are some serious issues with the TV when connected to WiFi, while watching Netflix or youtube, the video plays for some time and then it starts buffering, sort of just gets hung. This can be resolved by using LAN wire instead. Works fine when connected via LAN. My rating keeping in mind what you are getting for the price: Audio - 7/10 Picture - 7/10 Smart features - 8/10 WiFi connectivity - 2/10 Where to buy - Would recommend buying directly from MI website if you want additional warranty at a small cost. Else, go for amazon if you want the option of 10 day replacement incase you face any issues with the TV.",Average TV - Read before buying!,B07HB7SSPZ
"Tv performance is superb, screen and sound quality is good, Google voice control works awesome But I am disappointed with the auto play option, there no option to enable the default HDMI/AV, every time we have to go and choose the input option, when I called to MI customer care they don't know about this and visited nearest MI home even they also don't know about this feature. It will be useless without autoplay option, will get frustrated to select each and every for HDMI/AV. Hope MI will enable this feature in next release.","Happy with the tv performance, expect autoplay play option",B07HB7SSPZ
"It is ultimate option if you donot own a LCD or LED TV till date. If u have one already then its better to buy chrome cast for smart TV functions. Coming to this TV - Great sound, avg pic clarity, decent smart options, built in chrome cast does the job well, no VGA option for PC connectivity but can be connected through HDMA1 port if we have appropriate cable, No bluetooth out but have Headphone out option which may result in low audio output, Google Assist made search option easy with voice facility makes far better than Mi 4A TV. Software update is released only 1010 series as against to 1073 mentioned in product description by amazon. Overall opinion is best budget smart TV if durability does not taken into account",Good option for entry level smart TV under budget,B07HB7SSPZ
"It's almost more than one month I'm using daily. No issues still now.Product reached by time,,,well packed.Now the pros...1. you can't get better than this by this price. 2. very good to use the remote, fast reliable. 3. google assistant is another plus point. 4. youtube is installed. 5.Sound is ok. Now the cons...1. Picture quality is no way near as good as LG, Sony. 2. HDR is not effective at all in my eyes. 3. Very few apps are compatible from play store, also side loding is not effecting. 4. No browser is installed nor side loded. I was able to install firefox (android tv ver). But not all website are loding. 5. As a power user I need a rooted device but I have no idea how to root it.",Good product,B07HB7SSPZ
When I was planning to buy a new television I was no doubt to buy the MI TV but when I read all the reviews by the customers on Amazon I was so confused even I was scared to buy because of the negative comments but I'm trusting the brand The MI I am using the phone from the same brand so I have bought the television when I connect to the Wi-Fi I try to update the operating system of the MI TV now even prime videos is working very fine nice picture clarity too so I am a happy customer I am recommend to other customers too.,Awesome product from MI,B07HB7SSPZ
I’m Loving it. Best smart/Android tv ever in this cheap price tag (13500). If u buy same feature tv of others company u will have to pay minimum 24k (for LG). LG tv is also not smooth as MI. U will love it when u purchase. Sound quality is not too good but it is ok in this price. I have a suggestion for mi that u can also attached Boat speaker or any other good quality Dolby Sounds which sounds like Home theatre and u can also increase price by 1500 more so that customer will get a total quality package. Every customer loves Full complete Package.,Hats off MI you are Great,B07HB7SSPZ
Very good and more than it's performance than expected. Awesome and delightful. Delivered in time by Amazon team. Only after sale service has to be improved by MI company by providing proper field staff for verification of the item is in good in all aspects. Picture quality is very good. Only sound quality is to increased for more audiable.,Very nice Android TV of this Year.,B07HB7SSPZ
"This is a OK product. It's basically a bad product, but if you consider the price then you can somewhat justify it. First of all cons are: 1. The screen quality isn't good. The back-lighting is very bad and uneven. 2. Picture quality and colour reproduction isn't good. Most people buy a TV for watching contents but when the panel and picture quality, two of the most important factors aren't good enough, you can't call it a good product. Pros: 1. The sound is very good. 2. Nice design. 3. It runs on Android, it's a huge bonus, and till date I didn't have any lagging issues. - Overall considering the price it's not bad but not good either.",OK product considering the price,B07HB7SSPZ
"Beautiful tv, with loads and loads of features. I am writing this review after 1 and half month. I bought this tv on 8th November. No one can expect the number of features and customization mi has provided in their smart tv which is the cheapest in this market. With the new update there were some more features included. Pros(Things which others have not said): 1) Directly access cable/dish after booting on(New update) 2) Screen off - We can off the screen which takes almost no current and it power on very quickly(New update). 3) We can sideload applications like netflix, amazon prime - etc 4) Easily runs 1080p in youtube without any lag 5) Play games - There are games in the playstore made specifically for this tv. 6) Chromecast - This works like a charm, be it youtube or any other suitable app, casting to this tv is much more easier. 7) Screencast- We can even screencast in this tv, which i had not known before. 8) Mi IR cable to use cable channels using a single remote with some extra features. Cons: 1) Takes about 35s to boot the first time 2) No netflix 3) Still no amazon prime 4) Bundled offer of mi ir cable would have been better This tv is just a good value for money.",Amazing buy of the year!,B07HB7SSPZ
"Smart Features : Navigating to main menu is very difficult, but picture quality is not bad, in fact it's very good in this price range.","Buy, you'll not regret",B07HB7SSPZ
"I'm not a big fan of MI, but this product with the offerings and pricing really attracted me. I just wanted a functional screen to connect my PlayStation to. Picture Quality is moderate if you grew up watching Sony TVs. The screen isn't very bright but it does the job. For normal TV viewing, it works fine but takes a hit when it comes to gaming. Sound quality is amazing! 5 stars for that. The TV is both loud and clear. Chromecast- It's inbuilt. Works fine! But still a little shaky. Not the best Chromecast available. Streaming apps like hotstar are affected. Sometimes it won't cast. It just pauses the entire thing. WiFi connectivity is very poor. MI support would ask you to reset it again and again. But that really doesn't solve a hardware problem. For those of you who are looking for a Smart TV, this TV will not give you Netflix and Amazon Prime apps. Since I have a PlayStation so it isn't a problem for me. However, you get Google Play store. Not many apps but would do. The viewing angle isn't that great on this. Overall, this is a decent tv with a lot of features. But these features could use a little work and I'm hoping it would get better with newer versions. 3.5/5","Good buy at price- Ideal for viewing, not gaming",B07HB7SSPZ
"1. TV is good, nice picture and sound quality.Though I moved from Sony to MI, I was not much disappointed as price diff must he considered 2. Installation team was PURE RUDE team (so u have some local store selling same tv with almost price - i will blindly go fr them) 3. I have seen,people saying that they have to select TV as input everytime when they switch on the TV - My suggestion - Please go to setting, there is option to switch on TV from where it was left last as input - enable it 4. Google assistance is awesome (atleast much better than fire stick) 5. Prime and Nexflix not available 6. Remote is actually looks like a Cutie Pie",Good TV but installation team was WORST and RUDE,B07HB7SSPZ
"After 1 week usage i am writing this review. Pros : 1. Pure android 2. Google voice search through remote(95% accuracy) 3. Bluetooth remote .(range of coverage is very good) 4. HDMI 1 has ARC out so what ever the content either through apps or through tv it plays through sound bar . CEC control is there so it can directly control soundbar/ amp volume through tv remote. 5. Set top box STB control through MI IR cable . It can change the channel through TV remote. CONS: 1. NO Dedicated SD card slot as i found in other smart tv 2. PATCHWALL is suitable for hindi language people's no good content for Tamil, Malayalam , kannada. 3. Each time when you want turn on tv it will show as due you want this USB to be used for settop box control? You have to navigate checkbox and click ok. 4.TV audio output is terrible it is playing like a speaker kept inside a pot. use sound bar. 5.picture quality is not that much crispy it is like SD version playing in HD tv. 6. YES Bluetooth is advance then IR but you can't pair tata sky remote with this remote. They should consider both IR and Bluetooth in single remote. 7. Through TV remote if you want to change the channel of settop box means you have to come back to home again launch the tv guide app and play desired channel . So horrible.",Good for something! bad for something ! No one is perfect i mean TV,B07HB7SSPZ

"This is a good smart TV with lot of features in this range. As per my initial experience Hungama play and Google Cast is not working for me. Kindly provide me a solution. Demo and installation service from HTWAIT is pathetic, first they asked me to get it installed at their suitable time and then on that time called again to give excuse that engineer is not available at that time. After that they scheduled it for another day and on that day also delayed installation by 2-3 hrs. On top of that service engineer charged Rs. 150 for his visit and then when I called the HTWAIT again then he returned that amount and was giving lot of excuses.",Good Product but bad installation service,B07HB7SSPZ
Picture Quality is really poor and sound is pathetic. Its Operating System is really poor. Patchwall is populating all paid stuff. I have to reset OS atleast 15 times since I have purchased. I regret my decision of buying this tv. I suggest not to buy this tv. Its worthless,"worthless, poor quality tv",B07HB7SSPZ
"Display Worst display quality but in this price range bit better Sound Sound quality is also not good. SMART TV Features - NO Netflix, NO Amazon Prime Video.

"Screen mirroring is not supported for all devices even when it's connected to the same WiFi network gets connected but just shows blank screen for few seconds and disconnecs automatically, apps shows installation pending even after cleaning play store data. Need to subscribe for hotstar premium and hungama to view their content directly on TV or else you can screen cast from your mobile.typing on the Keyboard is bit time taking.Not Recommended for Amazon prime users. If not having WiFi network better not buy this.",Screencast problem and app installations,B07HB7SSPZ
"This is a phenomenal TV to buy at this price point. Being an Android TV out-of-the-box, it received the latest and greatest updates right off the bat and Patchwall was updated. To have Netflix and Hotstar installed, you have to wait until the update is finished installing. Also, It used to display 4 stars in few models, and we received a 3-star variant, although the power consumption is still the same, so that's not much of a big deal. The picture quality is mediocre, but you should not expect much, considering we got it for 10,000ish. The TV remote is minimal, but the voice control makes it very intuitive. Mi support centre is pretty quick as well. I was told of a 7-day installation window, but they showed up the very next day. That's fast. Although it asks you not to DIY installation and they won't be accountable for any damage in the process, but we didn't have any problem firing it right on! What I loved about this: 1. Seamless integration with the Android Ecosystem. Just install Google Home and Android Remote and you're all set 2. Clean and simple Android TV out-of-the-box 3. It's absolutely value for money Scope of Improvement: 1. Display Panel can be better 2. Patchwall has a few unnecessary bloats and can be done without 3.",Absolute Delight to watch,B07HB7SSPZ
"I bought this product around 24th Jan. TV looks value for money at this price. We asked the service vendor to provide default wallmount provided MI. But the wall mount is very poor, it doesn't have enough support to hold the TV firm at one place. due to a slight pull when changing cable, TV fall down and LED panel broken. Now there is no warranty for physical damage. Cost of service is equal to TV cost.",Poor Build quality and wall mount quality,B07HB7SSPZ

I purchased 12 Oct, and delivered 22 Oct and Till date 30/10/2018 no installation done by Amazon and Mi. So your TV is only show in the box. You don't use this TV.

I got the product on 12500 (10% cb on sbi card and 1000 as amazon pay balance) and selling price was 14999. I also got 1 year extended warranty. Delivery and installation was done at the same day. Ordered on 10th Oct and delivered on 12th Oct at around 3 pm. Installation guy came at around 5.30 pm on that day and it took only 30 mins. It was very good to see that kind of fast service. I will not say that this product has best display and sound quality. It has issues like remote gets disconnected and UI lags. But for this price point its value for money product. It will serve your purpose.,Value for money product,B07HB7SSPZ
Android TV is basically for youtube purpose and you can browse in web like movie rulz or any other websites. But don't expect all the android futures as like your mobile works. The app for your mobile android and TV android are different. You will get news apps and online video platform apps only. Games like asphalt and vice city also available. If you are buying it for professional use like video editing or financial and trading don't go for it. Over all ok ok,Android but not fully,B07HB7SSPZ
"Just installed, the picture quality is good. The service person will insist you to buy the tv mount from them, but we can get tv mounts at half the price from amazon. Also, mind he will charge 30 rs for the small AAA size battery to be inserted in the smart remote, thats way more costlier than normal. In regards to TV< awesome picture quality, and ease of navigation. if you are a tech buff, you can install various android apps and play with those. your tv feels like a big mobile at times.

"There's NOTHING smart about this TV. Netflix, Amazon primevideo donot work with the TV. Unfortunately, I found this out after purchasing the TV. The interface: The Google TV interface is an absolute pain! Takes a while to boot and every task is time consuming. When the TV is switched on, the home screen opens by default. From there it is required to switch to the desired source. The remote: There isn't a mute button on this remote! Are you kidding me, Xiaomi? Even the source cannot be switched, or the picture settings/brightness cannot be adjusted without going back to the Android home screen! On the plus side, the picture quality isn't bad and Amazon music, Hotstar do work. Definitely would not recommend. Instead, buy a decent non smart LED TV and a Chromecast/fire TV stick to go with.",Disappointed.,B07HB7SSPZ
Superb picture and sound but all android apps in this TV not working in Google play store And most importantly feature is not supported for HDMI Dolby digital and service engineer not a expert Just like road side mechanic untrained student This is not true Android TV.

I bought this TV in Jan 19 waited to write this review because I want to know all feature to this TV now we talk about main thing sound quality super. Display is He ready I played ultra HD video and I was shocked to see this Quality tv can play. RAM is sufficient but for this price it is suitable. Now price of tv is very cheap think like u buyng new mobile but difference is the tv can watch with family. I think sceen mirroring is the best option lot of u think there is no screen mirroring (Miracast) in previous one there was option but this there is no option because it is inbuild u can only connect mi mobile to it. This feature I use for play game mainly PBUG and chess with smart Bluetooth remote with voice recognition well that one is the best option. Because this one Android version so u can use YouTube and other apps,Brand Quality display for Game PUBG,B07HB7SSPZ
"There is no Netflix or Amazon prime on it, there are ways to install it, but then again there are issues. Amazon prime works properly if you install it using aptoide app market. You won't need mouse. But Netflix is harder to install and even if you manage to install it, you will need mouse to play or browse through Netflix. Now if you connect a Wireless mouse adapter, the voice assistant stops working. Anyway I can't complain much.

People who came for the installation were dumb and idiots. They firstly charged Rs. 400 for the TV wall bracket which was not informed earlier.

"Mi TV 4c pro is very good TV at this price point. It's an all in one device. Google integration is good & YouTube runs pretty well. Most important thing is, it has Bluetooth remote so bye bye IR & IR related problems & issues. 10x2 watts(20 watt) speakers are very good & very loud. I can hear the audio from the ground floor if I set the volume of the TV at 50%(TV is placed at 1st floor). Patchwall is good os but you need prime or premium subscription for further entertainment if you wanna use those, free subscription on some apps are for 10 days or maximum 30 days. On some apps like hotstar no free subscription you're getting, you must need a premium account to get premium content. That's what I didn't like about patchwall.

"Good product from MI. . Loved it. . Sound is clear and loudable. .if you add external speakers it enters into beast mode. Picture quality was good. . Not as bad as reviews given against resolution. 4k videos playing impeccably. . TV channels basically provide low broadcast. .For better enhancement go for HD channels. . Installation is user friendly. . USB, WiFi, 2TB external hard disk connectivity all super working. . Switching to TV channels takes two steps, apps like Netflix and prime video were not supported. . Hope MI fix those in future through update. . Overall super product at this cost. . Just go for it. .",Fabulous,B07HB7SSPZ
"Have been using this for a couple of months now. While it is value for money, you eventually realise lot of missed the tv has. 1. You cannot use Netflix on it in any ways. 2. Voice recognition i found it slow. 3. Takes time to load and at time the pairing also is slow. 4. If your only purpose is to watch movies there are better products if you pay a bit more.",Better options available,B07HB7SSPZ
"It's been 7 months the TV was working fine, all of a sudden the display went partially black. On raising a request to MI service center, their technician visited and said that its a physical damage which is not covered under warranty, so I'll have to pay ₹ 11,000 for the new panel (i bought this TV for 13k). I asked the technician to explain me how can a tv, which is in such a good condition (you can see I have not even removed the factory plastic) can get spoil. He said something might have fallen on the TV, I said if something has fallen, there must be some marks/ scratches etc. but he wasn't be able to explain. I called Amazon, they assured me that this issue would come under warranty, but nothing happened. MI service center started blaming me that I might have done something wrong. PS: Lost one loyal ""MI Fan"" pathetic service and product",Poor quality product and pathetic service,B07HB7SSPZ
"While purchasing I thought I will work for Amazon Prime and Netflix..but it's not actually, if however works okay with indian streaming apps like zee5, voot, sony Liv and Eros... although you have to Install these apps as it doesn't come pre-installed.

"Not good to buy, useless and moreover the Amazon is lying over term and conditions. They don't return once payment is done whether the Product is useful or not. They are just Mediators and working for brokerage.",Too small and after sales service is very poor,B07HB7SSPZ
"The screen quality is not good, the colours are not that bright. Rest features like sound, connectivity, remote and other things are good. SD channels looks faded on this TV.

"First of all .. delivery was late. Secondly they took ages in installation. And even though it's a smart TV.. its own Chromecast is not working. External Chromecast is not working. And Netflix is also not available for MI. So overall it's just a ordinary tv. No smart TV features. When it comes to screen quality.. it's not that great. Pretty average and grainy. But have to give points for a decent sound quality. Installation guy came after 10 days and told us about the fault and asked us to return / repalce it. By that time. Replace window was closed. So after calling customer care 10 times , they returned it. Pls save your money and don't buy this tv.",Worst tv ever. Lots of fault.,B07HB7SSPZ
Speakers sounds good at Avg. Low Volume level. When volume increases the tapping sound appears in speakers as if they are blocking the beat. Can be heard clearly when there is some bass in the audio. Overall Nice product. External speakers can also be used but it will add on to energy bill.,Nice Product in this price range,B07HB7SSPZ
"I have been using this product for a month now, and I see after using the TV for streaming only esp YouTube, This simply hands and the boot up asks for a factory reset. I have been dealing with this regularly and the frequency is just increasing. I believe the hardware is not competent enough to handle the software requirement. I am raising this with the MI support team as well",Hangs often for both Youtube and Cable TV streams,B07HB7SSPZ

"After using for 30+ days, here is my HONEST REVIEW. I got the device for 13,512/- with Cashback offers. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mi TV 4C Pro is a budget-friendly TV for the normal user. It does have good specs and is absolutely perfect for its price range. Don't compare it to high-end devices like Sony, Samsung worth 25k+ ₹. ==== 6 SAMPLE PICTURES ARE ADDED ======= Pros:- ===== 1. Patchwall works well. 2. Google play store is available and there are lots of free apps, others you can sideload(NetFlix). 3. Very easy to use simple interface. 4. Colors are very good for the budget. 5. Very smooth UI, no lag or clutter. 6. 1GB RAM + 8GB Storage. 7. Good Sound clarity. 8. Average build quality. 9. Good updates and support. 10. HDMI Ports x3, USB x2, 3.5mm port Built-in Wifi & Bluetooth. 11. Google Voice is really responsive and extremely correct. 12. Play tons of games on the big screen ( multi-player supported) 13. Add External memory ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Cons:- ====== 1. Viewing angles are not the best. 2. There is a bad reflection on the screen. 3. Miracast not supported, unlike the previous models. 4. Screencast(Chromecast) not working properly, most times lags. 4. Remote is Bluetooth and only 7 basic buttons. 5. No built-in support for Netflix(But can be sideloaded), but no Amazon Prime(cannot be sideloaded). 6. Out of 8GB storage only 4.7GB available to the user. Verdict :- ======== Display - 7 / 10 Design - 9 / 10 Sound - 10 / 10 UI - 10/ 10 Connectivity - 8 / 10 ------------------ Overall - 8 / 10 The Mi TV 4C Pro is a great device completely worth the 13,512₹ even with the minor cons. It is perfect gift for yourself and family. I've been using it for 30+ days now and there were no problems till this moment. For people complaining about Amazon Prime, Jio Apps, Netflix please read product descriptions before buying the device. Netflix can be sideloaded, Amazon prime can be watched from Google Chrome browser in TV. Thank you so much for reading my review, Have a nice day.",Worth the money without doubts ..........Honest Review 100%....!! ( See detailed ),B07HB7SSPZ
I didn't like some specific features like.. 1. It was taking almost two minutes to switch on the TV. When i talk to amazon customer care regarding this they said this more enough for this price. 2. We don't have autoplay mode for HDMI/AV that tunes to setup box which already available in 4A model 3. Amazon customer care was very much supportive to MI. They don't understand the problem and even criticizes issues that we are facing. I hope it not customer care it is provider care.,Performance is not great matter for Amazon customer care,B07HB7SSPZ
"I got the package MI tape UNSEALED but the normal taping was done. So I am suspecting it was a returned piece. Leaving that fact. It has good picture quality and overall build is OK. Being an Android tv it don't have all basic apps like Netflix, prime and voot etc on play store which is strange. But can be sideloaded(installed from USB). The software still have glitches but updates might sort it later. screen mirroring is little complicated but I havent got my S8 mirrored yet(tried all ways) No Doubt it is a good TV but has few defects which can be cured by coming updates. Let me say it again- Picture Quality is Good for which i was confused earlier.",Gives more than you pay,B07HB7SSPZ
"Picture quality is decent not best in class i liked it tho Sound quality is good but i use Philips soundbar with that its just awesome Cast sync is great loved it #PUBG player🤘😂 Content is great yea Netflix is not there yet Overall fit n finish is great And people who are complaining about sound quality issue just update it, its great after that. Only delivery was late for me i had to call more then 10 times to customer service. It took 2 days to reach from my nearest hub. That was very bad",Worth your money,B07HB7SSPZ
"After using this TV for a week, below are my observations - Screen is HD (720p) so if you watch from 4-5 feet distsnce, picture quality should be okay - Speakers are not the best I have heard, but does the job. Does not distort at higher volumes. - Takes some time to boot. So if you are used to non-andriod tvs, booting time can seem longer - Remote is bluetooth, so very easy to use. Voice search feature on remote works great.",Value for money,B07HB7SSPZ
"Mirroring experience is horrible. It takes too long to mirror your phone. Even you won't be sure if you could mirror it every time. Even if you manage to mirror it the connection gets disrupted frequently. Say, if you are mirroring a 2hr movie it gets disconnected atleast 3-4 times which is really annoying. After a long mirroring session you'll face lagging on screen. (It is important to mention that I am a hard-core friend of MI and I tried mirroring using note 4, note 5 Pro and 5a) There is no one key navigation to TV mode or default TV mode. Everytime you switch on the TV you'll have to select the source. It is problematic specially if you have senior citizens in your family. Finally the technician who came for the installation couldn't explain things properly citing that he had not been trained at all. So I'm worried whether they could provide proper service in future or not.",Mirroring and TV mode issues.,B07HB7SSPZ
"Great product company that is supported by a Horrible Customer Service Vendor/Team. If you are looking for good support to your purchase, i suggest Samsung or other brands that have established the value of customers than just online purchased and policies that cannot be tweaked. I highly recommend brands that listen to the customer's voice/needs and take steps and amend the policies on a case to case basis.",Awesome Product with Horrible Customer Service,B07HB7SSPZ
"Picture quality is really great.. Also bought one for my office.. I earlier had a tv from local vendor, which was cheap compared to this but when you see both side by side, you'll never by cheap Chinese lcd/led... I really don't care about smart feature, its craze stay less then a weak.. Then every tv is used as normal tv... Picture quality is the only thing that matters.... Go with this tv without thinking twice... Or even better, wait for the sale.. You can get it using credit card in less then 10k...nothing comes close..",Nice product... Worth asking price,B07HB7SSPZ

Typical to mirror/cast phone.) Bluetooth connectivity 5/10. (For Bluetooth connectivity you will have to need pairing. Without pairing any Bluetooth device would not be connect.

1)Screen mirroring is not working. 2)You can't find apps which are working on background. 3)Remote should have sophisticated. 4) youtube buffers even the net speed is quite high. 5) play store apps update and download is too much slow.

"Nobody is coming to install TV, If i install it on my own warranty will void and amazon is not accepting return. I am stuck with MI and Amazon. Now I want to return the TV, Amazon is saying you cant return the TV unless technician says the TV is defective and technician is not visiting to install the TV.

"ABOUT THE PRODUCT: Worst ever screen quality and color. The colors in display are washed away and looks like faded and washed. Dont go just behind the brand name ""MI"" bcoz still they r infant to tv market. My life's biggest mistake of buying this tv. About sound its good. Connectivity is good but if i insert pendrive and play movie, tv plays the movie by jumping from time...it cant play the usb contents flawlessly. Regarding youtube connectivity, this tv cant play 1080p videos. Max resolution it can play is 720p. This is not at all fair. About my return: Worst return i have faced in my life with amazon. I placed return by oct 23,2018 and GATI COURIER was expected to pickup within 4 days but due to their laziness and lethargic, GATI COURIER picked the tv by oct 29,2018 at 9:30pm and given acknowledgement slip. The tracking number always shown no data found. I used to call amazon and gati but both of them did not gave positive response. Daily i used to struggle with customer care but those persons only tried to escape by giving fake assurances and cut the call. Then on Nov 7,2018 i called amazon 5 times and after the struggle, they initiated the refund. Approximately i have called amazon more than 30 times to just process refund initiation. Finally amazon have to improve customer service and solve the issue of the customer before the stipulated time not after long time. And also amazon have to cut the service of GATI COURIER bcoz they spoil the amazon's name by their laziness.",Worst screen quality and color reproduction.

The TV is very good.It has good built in android Operating System.Sound quality is really awesome..I never expected such a good sound.Picture quality is pretty good but not up to the mark. Now coming to the performance overally it is not so fast.MI can fix some of the bugs. The bad thing I noticed was sometimes in the middle WIFI gets disconnected easily and when I am trying to connect it back it is not allowing me to connect instead the entire TV getting hang up.So this is the major issue I was facing which is not at all good.,Features are good worth the money. problem with Network Connectivity and Operating System,B07HB7SSPZ
Good one to go in for. Only problem is though it's not difficult to install you have to wait for services person to come which takestooooooo long. If you open warranty defects not covered. Sometimes problems with USB ports as they don't show up at all and once you restart it comes and works wonderful. Picture quality is very good sound quality is excellent screen quality very good,Good tv,B07HB7SSPZ
"Hi, Are you looking to buy a Tv in Mid-Range? Then this one of should be your choice. Why? Good Picture quality, not the best. But best in the Price range, Even it support 4k. They haven't mentioned but if you are playing 4k content it will run flawlessly without any problem, but it must be in USB. On YouTube, it Can play 1080P Smoothly. As its Wifi Support 2.4Ghz Band Only, not having 5Ghz If It would, Perhaps it would play 4k. Moving to the more specifications, You can read Description all specifications are given and I've personally Experienced as Working Flawlessly. Drawbacks: The Voice of its remote, Like Tik-tik in Every Impression, could make irritation. This Tv doesn't have, A must have apps such as Amazon Prime and Netflix. Tip to Mi- Please work on the Drawbacks to make it superb.",Good One But not The best.,B07HB7SSPZ
"TV though says its smart but it is not even smart as basic mobiles, Last time tv had option of miracast but now it has no such option which is replaced by google cast. This cast requires both mobile which is to be casted and tv, to be connected to some other WiFi, so it requires three devices, where as miracast or mirror share doesn't require such, only u switch on WiFi mode in tv and mobile and you can screen share. Main thing is it doesn't support some good browser at all. It doesn't come with basic apps like amazon prime or netflix, all it has some uselles third party applications in built, why the hell they couldn't has netflix or prime, only god knows. So even if you download google chrome some how, then also u cant watch netflix or prime in browser, its a total waste of money if you think its smart tv in low budget and buy. Its just a trail version and experiment failed product and people bought it in huge numbers, its not completely android just a patch version, only god knows when it will be updated, i bought it in first sale and never got any updates. Ridiculous product, please don't buy now, buy when they release tv with complete android version and able to install all apps in it. Now its just a experiment product.",Useless product,B07HB7SSPZ

This is awsome tv . 32inch is good size and this is working properly. This Tv dont have HDR . But the 43inch Tv has the HDR option. The tv has a Mi-remote which connects with Bluetooth. The Tv can have the mobile apps and can be used for using Internet with Wi-Fi and brodbank connection or ethernet. This is same like android moblile . And it supports google play store and youtube.

"Though the price of TV is very competitive, it is not upto the mark. If you are really on tight budget then only consider this.

"Regret buying poor quality TV, wish I could've spent some more money and bought a branded one. Within 6 month, the TV stopped working totally. Called MI customer care, they sent untrained and unprofessional technician, who assured me that within a week's time, the complaint will be solved. He submitted wrong diagnosis report in thier system and also submitted another report mentioning that the complaint has been solved (which I came to know later when made follow up on my complaint) Week passed, nothing happened then had to call thier CC again. They sent another technician when made regular follow ups, the senior technician visited on 8th day of my complaint, just to see the real problem, he did same thing. Assurance of fixing the problem within a week's time, since they don't have the Motherboard in thier stock. Bottom line: The problem isn't solved on 10th Day of my complaint, third class hardware provided by Mi, which lead the TV stopped working within 6 month. Untrained and unprofessional technician are thier whom they have outsourced the service issues, totally non-cooperative customer service executive. Totally waste",Total waste,B07HB7SSPZ

Really amazing in this price range with ample of feature to entertain. Patch wall and android combo is superb. I'm enjoying the interface. I recommend everyone to go with it. This is the best TV in this price range... Service of MI is also very good. Contacting them is a issue but better part is that they contact u back once you drop request on their portal. I have told this particularly because I saw some videos on you tube about their poor service in Mumbai. Anyhow I didn't faced any such problem in Hyderabad.,Best in the peice range.,B07HB7SSPZ
"It's an amazing product with Smart TV features, built in Chromecast, great! about sound quality, its loud but isn't crisp and clear, it's just loud. Wall mounting is pain in the butt since it doesn't come with wall mounting screws and bracket. Display, it's 720p not much to say. Overall good TV for this price range although i wish it was 1080p least. For the overall TV quality and what i brings to the table for this price, wouldn't mind paying tiny bit extra for 1080p.",Amazing product! Still 720p though,B07HB7SSPZ
I've started watching tv a lot after getting this (maybe that's a bad thing ;)) But i absolutely love the HD quality and it's a pleasure to watch movies/television and what not.. The Android system glitches at times.. Dunno if it happens with every tv or just a prob with mine. But otherwise i don't find any major issues.. it's totally worth the money.!!,Great Picture quality,B07HB7SSPZ
Mi Smart Tv is a value for money product. Previously I was using Philips led tv which we used for almost 4 years. As of now quite satisfied with Mi Tv experience. I will update later on as I continue using it. BTW I really got a great deal for this tv as I availed coupon from promoocodes.com .,Value for money product,B07HB7SSPZ
This is the right choice for a value for money smart TV. Picture quality is not top notch but while viewing from 6ft+ with 720p content we don't feel much. Android TV and built-in Chromecast is a great go 👍,Value for money Android smart TV,B07HB7SSPZ

"Please dont buy, unless its your first led tv. The tv is not worthy. Display is not good. I read some negative reviews about it, i ignored it and bought it. Now am suffering with the product, the Amazon is not acceptable for its return, unless its physical damage. The sound quality is also not good. Color is washed.

I have had used LG so it's not fair to expect the same picture quality & build. It's ok The disappointment is with VERY limited access to play store & the worst part is primevedio & Netflix aren't available in playstore.,Not so smart tv,B07HB7SSPZ
"Actually, I wouldn't say that Amazon is cheating... However the product is not upto the mark the way it is being advertised 1. Picture quality is very poor, infact i would not consider it as an HD TV. I have compared it with my old TV i bought 8 years ago. That old tv has better display... Somewhat i feel i got cheated on the display quality by MI 2. Sound is just fine. 3. Voice control is fine, but that remote without regular button takes lot of time to switch over to chennal/program 4. Installation was on time. No complaints from Amazon I would suggest the customer before buying it go to the local market check the picture quality then buy from Amazon",Picture Quality is not upto the Mark,B07HB7SSPZ
I have purchased this product on nov 2018 and now it’s get faulty ... on the screen there are many unusual lines appears during power on ... and after the complain there is no any supportive service provided by mi ... the technician who visit to examine the problem is not supportive ..they only give unnecessary excuse about the fault ... overall very bad product and bad customer care service by mi .. pls do not go for this product,Didn’t match the expectations,B07HB7SSPZ

Smart features are ok. Not too good. - CONS: Difficult to connect to win10 wireless display. Extra apps are required. previously it allowed to conn6 directly (earlier models of it) VOICE RECOGNITION: Recognition is goof but IT TAKES TIME (5 SECS) to start hearing your voice. they have to work on software/performance COLORS ARE AVERAGE (MORE THEN AVERAGE) not the best,check detailed comments,B07HB7SSPZ
first of all smart android tv 8900 rupees total amount paid after all the discount. amazon provide best delivery within 2 days and installation within 2 days through mi. led 32 inch provide best smart features with android update 9.0 ...still. provide 8...picture qaulity is also good with this range.sound is also awesome....but cloud tail seller provide wrong serial number on bill so my installtion is some time delay . overall exeperince is good....if u r using dth service i think best picure quality u got . you can also watch 4 k vedios.,overall good android tv with best suitable price.,B07HB7SSPZ
I think this TV is the smartest cheapest TV in the world I bought it in offer for 12 k but the price is 15k U can use this smart phone alsoas a laptop also,Smartest TV in world with voice. Assistant for 15k,B07HB7SSPZ
"Overall the look and feel, the features are good. But unfortunately I ran into a problem just after 2 months of purchase. The display as shown in the images suddenly started showing because of a jerk caused due to wind from my window. The TV did not fall on the ground and from outside there is no physical damage being observed. I have been told by the engineer that the panel inside has broken and this is not covered under warranty. I purchased in 11,000/- and the cost of replacing the panel would be 9,000/-. My question is what kind of panel is there which got damaged just because of jerk?? It is very unfortunate for me and it is a total loss.",Very delicate display panel and could get damaged,B07HB7SSPZ
Picture Quality is strictly ok - not impressed. One additional important shortcoming is that you cannot download prime video or Netflix on this - you need an Amazon fire stick. Smart TV hone ka kuch Matlab nahi!,Unimpressive.,B07HB7SSPZ
"Mobile screen on tv direct not connect, Need extra hotspot device for mobile screen mirror, it's not smart way.

"This is an awesome TV at this price point. Excellent picture quality ( I personally liked it's 4k compatible display) , samooth interface, highly responsive remote, speakers are also good enough and loud enough that you won't require any exterior speakers.

TV with ample features in a very affordable price. Superior product by MI. But it lacks Netflix/Amazon prime and if it's Mirrored with phone it goes off automatically within half an hour. Apart from above everything's GREAT!,Smart TV within Budget,B07HB7SSPZ
Don't worry it's best product in this range. Picture quality is good sound is also good I connect my speaker so I can't say much about sound. Yes I played video on YouTube so it's picture quality is nice. I was worried about picture quality because people comment it's not good but the truth is they play in vga cable,Worth buy,B07HB7SSPZ

Screen turns black and asks to reset to factory data. MI has created a good TV but quality and durability of the product is zero! Not recommended..",No Durability.. Worst TV,B07HB7SSPZ
Picture quality is not that great thus we cannot expect more from a 720p panel but i think it should be atleast 1080p. Screen is bright enough but at night it irritates our eyes when complete white screen apears. The backbone of this tv is its interface which is the fastest i believe under 30k tvs. You won't feel any lag while navigating the keys. Fast internet is must for this tv to get the 100% potential of it. I believe at least 5 mbps or more. 4k playback is smooth like a butter not a single lag.,Good tv in budget section!!!!,B07HB7SSPZ

After delivery of this product I submitted TV installation request on MI site and installation time scheduled on 06-10-2919. In that request form of TV installation, charges mentioned for wall mounting were 599 Rs.and I was ok with that, But when service engineer came for TV installation he was demanding 1200 Rs instead of 599 Rs.and behaving arrogantly and saying that he had bought this stand specially for me and I have to pay 1200 Rs for that else he wont do TV installation. When I refused to pay him 1200 Rs.he put that TV in box again and went back without doing TV installation. This is really ridiculous, I wanted that TV to be installed before festive session of Dushera i.e. on 08-10-2019. Please do the needful and revert me as soon as possible.",Worst Service,B07HB7SSPZ

I use screen saver for wall decorations also that look amazing of my family pictures. All these are +ve points. Let's talk about -ve points, this is not fully Android TV you can not install prime video, Netflix Airtel tv etc. But you can screencast them from your mobile.

"The picture quality is bad due to lack of uniformity and appears similar to a wall on which paint has been applied in an uneven coating. The bluetooth of the TV does not function well and the output sounds as if the bluetooth speaker is suffering from sore throat. When I called Mi TV service centre, they heard the problem and then refused to help. I then returned the product on Amazon as this was really a bad deal.

About the TV- it’s the best that you can get in this price range. However there the screen always shows your shadow and the speakers are not that good.

"I bought Mi TV 4C Pro almost 3 months back. Till now no issue faced. Build quality is ok. Picture quality could have been better but can't ask for more considering its price. I suggest to use HD set top box for better TV experience. Overall all it has great features like youtube, Google play store also you can sideload other app via pendrive",Nice TV considering its price,B07HB7SSPZ

"If you want to buy this TV spend a few minutes to get a detailed review about this TV from my usage. After examining all the review videos available in youtube and reviews in the review section I bought this TV. I bought this TV for 13,498 which I got a discount by paying through SBI debit card. And let's discuss about the TV PROP'S > This TV has a adorable picture clarity which is best for this price range it can highly support 720p resolution. > The sound clarity is very extreme it delivers a high range sound even bass is very good when standed. > It has updated 8.0 Android version with all upgraded apps like YouTube , Google search etc. > TV has enabled voice search feature which runs quite decent. And the Bluetooth remote is the best thing as you can use it from anywhere with out sitting behind the TV. > It doesn't even require a stabilizer but using one is a good task. CONS • There are no major defects that can be said about this TV but some major issues that I found are: * The TV gives a little noticable lag while shuffiting between apps. * And even cast screening is a big task to connect at first I can easily casted my screen but now it is not getting cast screen I don't know why. * And when I used Bluetooth mouse in the TV it responds slowly compared to PC's as I don't know Android may not give a good mouse optimization. * Consumes lot of data when connected through hotstop or Ethernet. * TV comes with complete plastic body and metal parts are available even the stands are made of high grade plastic (but this is not a high end concern it give a best experience) When I compared this TV to it's older versions of 4a (32""),(43"") they don't have a updated android versions and YouTube will support a highest video resolution of 720p but in this TV it will even support 2160p (4K) happy for this feature Overall this is best TV for the people who think to have a smart TV in low affordable price this is the best choice. Even we have VU, Thompson, and other branded TV sellers which cost a bit higher than this TV As MI is a trusted company as we know that so everyone can happily buy this TV without any concern as there are no major issues with the TV",Value for every penny you invest.,B07HB7SSPZ
"Pros: For this price- nice picture, good sound, not much vibrant colors except some over makeup channels like ""colors"" Online streaming was good, viewing angle not bad, Voice search and google assistant was nice, Delivery, installation and demo was good and in time. Cons: Body panels are Not fitted properly i have attached the picture to see but this is not a big issue human errors will occur In some videos the sound are not supporting but we can use the app MX player like that viewing angle 170 degree it shows more contrast but i watch in straight so this is a con who are watching in 170 degree Pros in one line : This is nice one Cons in one line : Nothing we can do perfect 100%","Nice product to buy in this cost, But the body panel was not fitted properly",B07HB7SSPZ

"Moving from CRT to MI SMART TV was an experience.Budget range Smart TV 32' options are massive , making it difficult to shortlist. 4C pro giv s you the good over all TV experience. Patchwall does a descent job if you have no previous benchmark. It was easier for to adapt. Picture, sound quality is good for a small room. Streams content beautifully. Overall a good experience. Cons: Patchwall could be a tad more intuitive based on your viewing history. Loading time for content could be a faster.(could depend on Internet connection too..,slow for a 12mps connection).",Good piece of work MI......,B07HB7SSPZ
"This is my first android TV , i wasn't expecting much because of the price range. You would get only what you pay for. So people stop crying that picture quality is not good. I can play 720P quality videos without any lags. Its pretty good and the experience is awesome. The only drawback i felt was, the installation service provided by Amazon. I received the TV on Nov 2nd and the installation service executive told that slot is available only on Nov 8th. I don't know why would they need 6 days. Luckily installation wasn't hard and i did it myself I would recommend Amazon to change the installation service partner because I could see lot of complaints about the installation.",Expectation Satisified,B07HB7SSPZ
Picture quality is not so good. But in this price it is okay. Sound clarity is also not well. Remote is fantastic. Connection with other devices is easy.,It is okay in the low cost range,B07HB7SSPZ

"Writing this review after using the mi 4c pro for 3 days. Keeping in mind the price i paid which was rs 12600. The picture quality is very good. I was particularly impressed with the sound this tv pump out, in normal use i was only using it with around 25 % of sound level. Though both speaker are down firing and i would have preferred front firing. Built quality felt decent. The only problem i had was that its while using it with casting it got hang with picture but sound continued to move other then that i felt it to be best worth for money tv out there in the market.",Best value for money.,B07HB7SSPZ
My brother use this TV this is for futuristic TV on very low price TVS scan good good feature is internet connection the support of all reports TV picture quality is very good for price .. thisTV attracting point is Bluetooth remote .. dish TV is very useful and user friendly..,Great deal for the great price for MI TV,B07HB7SSPZ
It's an Android TV but it does not support two major streaming apps Amazon Prime Video and Netflix. Moreover its google play store has only few countable apps. You can access only few apps. Totally useless this TV is now. Not smart at all.,Not an Android TV,B07HB7SSPZ

"I m using the tv from last 7 months. I m very happy with this product of mi really superb led tv I think its the best. The only thing I miss in this tv is jio app , Netflix etc apps not in its playstore have to install via pendrive that works but it will be great if they r provided by mi playstore itself Otherwise pictures quality, sound, connectivity, smart features, tv remote etc are really appreciable I strongly recommend to everyone on behalf of my 7 months experience with mi led tv 4c pro 32 to buy it Great experience",Strongly recommended for everyone. Overall all give 4.8 rating stars to the tv. Apps like jio,B07HB7SSPZ
"The TV was delivered on time and the installation person came the next day on time. I will cover what others haven't - I have checked casting from Mi Redmi Note - works flawlessly. Once you connect to same network, cast button appears. You can also cast mobile screen. The Google voice assistance too works flawlessly. However when I try opening Hotstar, it says can't understand. All other general commands like what is weather like etc works. Sound is loud and clear. Apps in appstore are very less and pretty much useless as of now. Hope to get Amazon TV at least in future. I have used the TV the whole day and wifi works without problem. Frankly, I was relieved that online purchase turned out to be good so far.","Excellent performance .Sound good, and no wifi problem",B07HB7SSPZ
I am frustrated from this mi TV .I bought this product just 1.5 month before.

"Pros. 1. Good picture, sound quality, 2. Really smart as it has Android OS 3. It has voice search assistant through remote. 3 Almost everything is good other than mentioned below Cons.. 1. Sometimes I feel brightness and contrast is on higher side. 2. When you cast your mobile it hangs after some minutes approx 15 min.",Worth to buy. Awesome,B07HB7SSPZ
"Satisfied with Amazon services and mi brand but the service engineer who was came to home, even he doesn't know the proper installation and demo of the TV. Simply he is giving the blind reasons for the settop box is not working, remote is not working like.. Even though the wallmount installation is not done properly.. Obviously mi needs to send a qulified service engineers to install a TV and demo for the customers.",Overall the TV is very good with this cost..,B07HB7SSPZ
"I already own a 43"" model of MI which does not have Bluetooth. But this pro series has Bluetooth. I mostly prefer using my Bluetooth headphone with MI TV which I like about this TV. It has Google play store with only TV compatible apps, otherwise apps can be installed via USB. Picture quality is little disappointing but still we cannot expect much quality from a 720p TV. My other 43"" MI TV's picture quality is great in which I cannot spot any pixels. But with this TV pixels are clearly visible sometimes. I will recommend 1080p or higher models of MI TVs. But under 15k , it's totally worth it. I got this one for 14k on 1st Jan2019. Also I'll be using this TV only for watching movies and series. This TV supports my 2TB Seagate harddrive. Sometimes the default media player will not support audio while watching movies, but then I installed VLC player which fixed this issue. Impressed by its features at this price tag.",Bluetooth feature is great for private listening!,B07HB7SSPZ
"For this price range, product is just off the charts. I would recommend it to anybody. Decent looking, thin, weightless. Played videos up to 4k, plays it smooth. Couldn't be happier. Thanks to MI for a great product and on time techie for visiting n installing and thanks to Amazon for the quick and safe delivery.",Best in the class and price range.,B07HB7SSPZ
Most of the Popular Apps are not working on this Smart TV.....those who a re looking for Netflix/Amazon Prime or even Gaana/Wynk/Airtel TV etc. should avoid this TV. It has nothing in its app Store.....MI should upgrade this.,Average ...should avoid if u want to run all apps on this TV.,B07HB7SSPZ
Amazon lists this as a smart TV fully knowing that half of the apps don't work....expect the customer to read the description but why fool people by listing it as a smart TV when as on date it is not fully functional with all features...this is unfair trade practice and misguiding...hoping someone will miss the description and be fooled...,Deliberate Incorrect listing from Amazon.,B07HB7SSPZ
"It is very cheap in market rates & very high qaulity in this price range. Full paisa vasool chiz hai, sound, display, networking, voice search is awesome, overall everything is great.

"Product is very good in the budget but the Amazon is really really not trust worthy, I didn't get the cash back which was promised by them. So, before buying due to cashback make sure you take screenshots of your offer because they keep on changing the offer and later on they asked you to show us the offer which you can't if you didn't take any SS. Better go with Flipkart.",Better go with Flipkart,B07HB7SSPZ
The TV is good and it has all the ability which a smart tv should have. The picture quality is good. Brightness is little bit low compared to other TV's. The Bluetooth remote is highlight of the TV. Cons are: There are no Amazon prime video app support and also Netflix. Overall it's a good TV to buy within the budget.,A over-all performer,B07HB7SSPZ
my 1st impressions after installation was poor picture quality; sound quality ; and wifi connectivity issues.. I thot this is what i get for 13500 as this is my first MI tv.. i use samsung and sony earlier..But with one software update given by MI everything changed.. sound is good now.No connectivity issues .. Go for it for an android experience at this low price..,initialy felt not up to mark..but with one update its amazing now,B07HB7SSPZ
Although a good product but very much disappointed with it Chromecast feature and mirroring. The phone don't get mirror and also the other apps casting don't work well stops in middle. There is no additional slots to connect home theater.,Not as per expectations,B07HB7SSPZ

Nice Product.,Nice Product.,B07HB7SSPZ
Hardly two months since I bought this TV and it has started hanging and crashing,Please spare some money and buy something else but not MI tv,B07HB7SSPZ
Average quality.. reasonable price... Free installation is fraud don't believe... Inorder to fix they will take additional charge of 400rs basic Nd 1600 for adjustable...,Average.. go for it if no other option,B07HB7SSPZ
mi is the way to go. overall all very good screen amd features at this price segment i would recommend to buy from mi.com during sale so products will be more cheaper. no installation was given in my area.,bang for buck,B07HB7SSPZ
"Received faulty product, suddenly picture shakes up n down and cracking sounds rises, raised return request on 3rd day after installation. Also raise complaint about pickup guy as he wants us to unscrew the product and repack it.",waste of money,B07HB7SSPZ

"I am writing this review after using this TV 1 month. My experience with this product is average. Picture quality is good, but voice quality is bad. Connectivity is not good.

I used this tv since November 2018 But recently I have face some problems as well as my friends who also buy this product Problem no.1 is big issue Tv screen have one black dot on screen this dot appear automatically and 2 more dots on right side too Problem no.2 is some time it can't cast properly with my redmi note 4,Screen issue after 1 year,B07HB7SSPZ

"An amazing option. Xiaomi has provided the best features in such an affordable range. Yes, Amazon prime video and Netflix are not available but can be easily downloaded from the APPLOID TV application. Still Netflix isn't supported but Amazon prime video works amazingly. Will highly recommend the product. Great services buy Amazon but the installation was delayed.",Value for money.,B07HB7SSPZ
"If you are looking to invest in a good TV, then you will spend upwards of 20,000 to get a TV from Sony or Samsung or LG. The Xiaomi Mi LED Smart TV 4A delivers a great HD viewing experience. Don't expect the same quality you'll get when you spend a 20,000 on a TV, but the experience is pretty good or almost equal.",Budget King!,B07HB7SSPZ
What kind of smart it is it doesn't even have wireless display option. It means we can't screen mirror the on this TV without Internet connection only option left is using chromecast that too it lags.

This TV is not senior citizens friendly... Think a lot before buying.. Not sure why mi has made the process of starting the TV so complicated..

We have to purchase it,Mounting whether it is table or wall could hsve been made easy,B07HB7SSPZ

"Just got this one delivered and installed the same day and it is fantastic! Recently, I discarded my samsung 32"" smart tv with nearly same specs but this one is way SMARTER than samsung and with patchwall+oreo, it multiplies the user experience! sound quality is better as compared to samsung and picture quality is somewhat same. Although, one thing I am missing is direct screen cast(Samsung TV had an input option as screen mirroring) .There is no such option yet but an update and I will check whether screen cast is available or not after the update. I can use the built-in chromecast , but it requires both devices to be on same network with internet connectivity (WiFi) and I discontinued my WiFi due to some reasons. Also, there is no option to set AV or HDMI input as default, i.e. You have to select AV each time you want to watch TV, which is absolutely no problem to me, but it disturbs my parents, but they will cope up. Rest, everything is fine and I got this for 12,500 (1500 instant discount+1000 rs. cashback) . This is a must buy SMART TV. There are some tips: > Do not open the box yourself (wait for technician otherwise if anything happens, you are responsible) > If you opted for wall mount, do not pay a penny more than 400 > Visit the website provided for installation request and contact the xiaomi customer care number if you need any help. > Buy battery beforehand as they are not provided in TV I will update this review after some time.",Just go for it!!,B07HB7SSPZ

# Delivery by amazon is not nice.installion team not come by scheduled time. # Mi tv 4c pro value for money @15k.but i bought it in amazon sale for 12.5k. # Picture quality is good in online streaming.but suffer slightly at SD setupbox. # Sound is loud and not the best in clarity. # Screen display quality is not good.still we can see some washed out whites when booting. # Google os and patchwall os on 1gb ram.good but struggle some times. # Wifi issue is series.if wifi disconnect while using then it makes while tv hang until your restart. # mi tv remote not working some time.when tv hang and struggle. # Patch wall content one of the best try but simply frustrating bcoz all things need sign up and subscription to watch content.they say morethan half of the content is free but thats not true. # Installation team not tell anything clearly about repair and service within period of warranty. #overall if mi fix's bugs via update then it's all fine.good android tv from mi.you can give a try.,# Worst delivery by amazon. # mi tv 4c pro best value for money.,B07HB7SSPZ

"NOTE: @ If you select brand-authorized TV installation, then DO NOT unbox the tv until MI representative arrives. This ensures, that if TV is damaged in transportation, then you will get replacement easily. @ If you didn't choose installation, then just SHOOT the video of unboxing by yourself, to avoid any hassle in case replacement is needed. @ Amazon Prime and Netflix are not inbuilt, but can be Side-loaded !!! @ To use your Set top box with android interface, you need to buy MI IR cable and set it up. * OR else directly connect the set up box via AV or HDMI port, to use it conventionally. @ Out of 8GB memory, you only get around 4.7GB free to use (check the image attached) There are Hundreds of review on this TV here as well as on youtube, but NONE explains the TV's potential completely and what its actual flaws are. Here's a quick Fact for the User's complaining about the LESS cost to benefits ratio, guys if you buy a Android TV box alone which has processing capacity similar to this tv, then it would alone cost you more than 5K rupees & here you get this TV with that android setup with various other feature under 15K. So just check once, what options you have before complaining. Eventually I bought this TV, since I was already using 4A 43 version for months and wanted smaller version for bedroom. Now after using this TV for over 3 weeks, I am stating my DETAILED user experience. Its a detailed & huge review, but do read it, if you want to invest this much amount. ●● If you want to get quick overview of the device, then read below else scroll down for Detailed Review ●● # Firstly its budget friendly & ONLY Smart TV under 15k in the current market. # Has Most number of Output port ( 1*AV, 3*HDMI, 2*USB ). # Has Android 8.1 out of the box along with inbuilt Bluetooth # Has Dual interface - MI Patchwall & Android TV ( I mostly prefer android TV interface ) # Remote has Bluetooth & Voice Search with sleek profile. # Has better processor compared to predecessor along with 1GB RAM + 8GB storage ( 4.7GB actual ) # Speaker Output is low. # Need IR cable for using set top box with android interface. # Amazon prime & Netflix is NOT preloaded, but can be side loaded. # Native Display is ONLY HD, though 1080p & even 4K videos from youtube works well (check images attached). # Can install & play tons of High quality games like RR3, etc (check images attached). # Finally smartphone mirroring works fine most of the time. FULL DETAILED REVIEW :----> BUILT QUALITY : ------------------ # Has combination of plastic and aluminium for the main body. Its not great, but above average. # Table top stands looks bit flimsy, but are workable. * The screws which are provided in the box, DOES NOT fits the tv perfectly, so I bought new from local store. # It has averagely slim profile, not the slimmest in the market. # Speaker Placement is inconvenient. Since they are placed at the bottom, so when you keep it on table top, the sound tends to dampen and bulge. # Has good ventilation for electronics and it hardly heats up. # Overall built quality is above average. DISPLAY QUALITY : --------------------- # It has very Thin bezels, which looks great. # Video resolution is 1366x768p, but 1080p videos works fine on it. * 4K videos on youtube runs smoothly as well. # Viewing angle are good compared to price. ( Check the images attached ) # Contrast is above average, Brightness is good and colours are quite vivid. # Display quality is also above average, not very great. REMOTE CONTROL : ----------------------- # Its very sleek and compact. # Has only 7 buttons and is easy to operate. # Fortunately it has Volume buttons, which is handy. ( I have couple of android TV boxes without volume button on remote, so I know the pain of using mouse to adjust the volume :P ) # Placement of Voice search button is improper. Its just below Power button, and I end up pressing power button a lot. # Finally its bluetooth, so no need to point it towards tv for operation. OTHER FEATURES : --------------------- # It has Dual interface, i.e. Patchwall and android TV. Has tons of content. # Many games can be installed (till you have memory left), including multiplayer games. # Google voice search is very useful, if you don't want to use keyboard. # Processing speed is fast and I haven't detected any lags yet. ( Lags in streaming can be due to slow internet speed, not due to hardware ) # Bluetooth and wifi connectivity works perfectly. CONS : ------ # Speaker output though rated 20W, is NOT upto the mark. My 16W JBL speakers has better and louder sound. # Placement of speaker is inconvenient, as in table top position, speakers face the table and sound dampens. # Internal Memory is very LESS. # NO Netflix and amazon prime pre loaded, though you can side load them. # Miracast not supported. Even normal smartphone mirroring lags sometimes. # Native resolution is just 720p HD, though the 1080p videos works on usb & 4K on youtube. # Screen is Slightly reflective, its similar to almost all the other LED tv's. # Mixed experiences of after sales service. CUSTOMER CARE : -------------------- # Firstly the installation is a Joke. My installation was scheduled 16 days after my product Delivery and the fun part is, there's ONLY 10 days replacement window for this product :P # Company only takes replacement if the product is opened by their Representative, so there's NO point of return window time frame. # MI has mixed reviews for repairs and services. Though I have not encountered any problem with any MI tv yet, I have had issues with other mi products and service center near me is always very helpful. VERDICT : ----------- Considering all the facts, if you are fine with above average Display quality, want a Smart tv and if you have tight budget, then this the TV you should certainly go for. Trust me, you won't get any better deal than this least for coming couple of months. If you have higher budget, then certainly explore brands like sony, samsung, etc. This is NOT a perfect smart TV, but for the given price and 2 Years of warranty, its NO brainer to choose this, its certainly worth the investment.",DETAILED REVIEW after 3 WEEKS of Usage !!!,B07HB7SSPZ
