"Good tv but its have some bugs. Saved aspect ratio settings changes to 4:3 on everytime of turn ON. and 4k 60fps videos playing well . Remote need some improvement, some times tv doesn't recognise the remote. The special feature of voice recognition is not working.",Need some improvements,B07TNVR737
"Excellent TV . Am already blown away. Will write a detailed review in few days. After 1 day usage . 1. Display is terrific. 4k with hdr makes it awesome . Blacks are brilliant and brightness are good too . 2. Sound could have been better. Not that it is bad but lacks some kinda punch. 3. UI is pretty simple mostly Google . Smooth and easy . 4. Netflix, YouTube and few apps are inbuilt but missing Amazon prime video . Though you can cast it by inbuilt chrome cast . 5. Looks are great. Thin bezels 6. Remote is okay . Very minimalistic but does the job . You can control the TV by smartphone though 7. Major advantage of this TV is Google assistant . Works like a charm everywhere and you don't have to type . I got the TV for 17k . Exchanged my old TV for 13k and extra 2k discount for SBI card. Can't ask for more. It was a steel deal on Amazon festival time.",Awesomeness,B07TNVR737
It's size is only 49 inch not 55 inch... Size issue,It's only 49inch not 55 inch... Please show right size to the buyers,B07TNVR737
Ordered on 2nd October and tv is is delivered on 4th and my old tv was taken in exchange offer .The installation was scheduled on 9th and to my dis may the installation person didn't turn up.All the excitement that would have been there had installation taken place on the scheduled day has evaporated and there is no proper respone.The mail received threatens that if rescheduling for installation not done then it will be cancelled.I do not know what they mean by that.The long gap in installation and missing the installation date in not pardonable. They should open their eyes at l east now.,Inordinate delay in installation of TV and not turning up on appointment day,B07TNVR737
Hd channel viewing is good.sd channel viewing not good,Not bad,B07TNVR737
I have purchased this TV in Dusara Sales. TV is simply Awesome with extraordinary features. You feel great view with only HD channels. Only missing thing is Amazon Prime. I am eagerly waiting for that. Probably it may include in next update as per TCL announcement. You can enjoy 4k videos only if you have Gud internet connection. Please review all comments and compare with other brands also and then take decision.,Simply Awesome,B07TNVR737
"Have to say , This is awesome! The 43"" TV is the variant which I bought , I use it a lot for Netflix , Prime and Playstation. Tried running few things in 4k (Youtube Videos) it was amazing! Before going to Pro's con. Keep in mind this is a budget 4k TV. Pro's :- 1. Fairly Cheap 2. Android 9 is intuitive and easy to use , You need to download Apps like Hotstar and Prime. 3. Superb brightness and multiple screen settings to adapt as per your need. 4. FIFA is a joy to play on this! 5. Alexa integration is good but there are flaws. 6. Doesn't feel bulky. Cons 1. Alexa integration cannot turn on TV! But can turn it off. 2. Takes 5-8 seconds to start after switching off the Plug. 3. Voice recognition has issues when the TV is playing something. 4. Could've done with a better remote design (Perhaps removal of Netflix button?) Overall , the TV is bang for buck , you get what you pay and for as little as 21k (Bought with Discounts and all) it's absolutely amazing. I have not added the volume component since I don't mind having a lower volume.",MVP TV!,B07TNVR737
I got this for 32k during sale n i believe at that price I have no rights to complain about anything..worth the price ..n trust me even if u guys buy it for 40k its worth..all ends r sorted m pretty satisfied,Steal deal...,B07TNVR737
"I had purchased a TCL 65 inch TV on Amazon on 29th, September which was delivered on 4th October. The installation was supposed to be done on 6th through a booked slot during the purchase. No one turned up on 6th. After repeatedly escalating the matter on Amazon no one on the TCL installation department has bothered to respond. It has been 4 days past the due date and finally I have got the TV installed on my own. The service is really poor. Amazon was good enough to reimburelse the amount but the issues faced were too many. Now looking at the installation service I am afraid that if something is to happen to the TV I am expecting to face a lot of issues. The TV on the other hand is value for money. Really happy with the TV so far..it has built in android so need for a fire stick as well.",Poor installation service provider. Good Tv.,B07TNVR737
Speechless! Awesome job TCL hats off... deal is more worth than every penny. Picture quality is very good. Audio quality is very good. App opening takes little time but it's OK. 4k video are playing without any interrupt. I can rate this TV 10 out of 10.,TCL 43P8 Review,B07TNVR737
"The TV is great for the price. Got it on Sale during the Durga Puja. One thing though is the support of TCL. No one came to install even after 5 days of delivery. I had called TCL several times before I decided to mount it on the wall myself. Now after 2 weeks the technician calls me up and says he would like to come and install it. Nevertheless, Amazon delivery was super fast. Ordered in the evening and got delivered next day afternoon.","Good TV, super fast delivery but support could be better.",B07TNVR737
Product was delivered on time. Got installed by service person promptly. Is working well. I think as sd channel picture quality is not that good as what we see in showroom...it's nice but not sharp. Amazon prime installed through the play Store and working well.no issues as mentioned by others till now..today is first day ... only thing where not satisfied is that expected very sharp images and pic quality like seen in showroom.. may b i m wrong. I don't know if the tv is at fault or not. After 3 days..i can see dead pixels on the screen. Picture quality is really bad. Requested replacement...,Request replacement.,B07TNVR737
I bought this tv on 30th September 2019. But today 18th october we got some white line in the right side of the tv. We required replacement of the tv.,White line in the corner of the tv,B07TNVR737
"It's a wonderful tv in 43 inch segment. Thanks to amazon and TCL. 4K experience has been amazing, its fast and efficient in terms of performance. TV comes with wall mount and also free service installation. Didn't try gaming yet. Decent storage and RAM are available. Unfortunately, I didn't get my free service installation yet. Overall it's good to have it on Amazon festive offer with a good deal.","Looking for 4K 43"" here it's is",B07TNVR737
My remote control is not working properly and I am looking for all equipments,Remote control not working,B07TNVR737
"The television may be a good product for a budget price. But even after purchase, for 10 days no one turned up for installation. I waited to the core and finally after couple of week returned the product. Very poor service provider (TVS-E). They act like they don't have any connections with amazon if we contact. Think of post purchase service. It's gonna be a nightmare. So simply returned the product.",Good product worth for money. Very poor installation service. Suffered a lot and returned,B07TNVR737
Writing review after 2 days use. Timely delivery (thanks Amazon) and stellar support on prompt installation (thanks Amazon and MV Enterprises). TV boots up fast and the picture quality is breathtaking. Chromecast built-in is an added benefit and works super fast given my 50 MBPS internet connection. Been binge watching 4K movies and shows on Netflix over weekend and very happy with the purchase. I intend to write detailed review after sometime teati g Xbox One and STB.,Excellent Product 65 inches LED 4K,B07TNVR737
"The tv i got was already used by someone else the stickers were not there, wall mount missing in the package. I bought the same tv outside i could easily tell the difference and the other problem is Tv screen goes black with audio still on after few minutes. The installation guy didn't show up still and i cant get replacement till i get installation done. And the best one is there are no returns for the product. Stupid product with stupid installation service and as far as Amazon goes this is their worst product by far and my worst experience on amazon",Plenty of problems and amazon sucks for sending an used product,B07TNVR737
"Tcl 43inch 4k tv is amazing, picture and sound quality is awesome as expected. It's a very good buy in smart tv segment.",Awesome picture and sound quality,B07TNVR737
"The picture quality is great. The micro-dimming technology sometimes feels weird. I guess you turn that feature off though. Apart from that the tv is amazing. Great picture quality, fairly decent audio quality. Tons of features as it is an android tv. Takes almost a minute to turn on, but i guess thats with every android smart tv. Even though i have the apple tv connected, but its great to have amazon prime work on the native OS. I cant say anything about the voice recognition as i have not used it yet, and dont plan to use it in the future either. For 30k the tv is a steal.",Great Picture quality. Decent Audio. Amazon Prime works too.,B07TNVR737
I got the defective screen in sale. Very bad experience from Amazon side.,Bad product,B07TNVR737
"Coming to the product , it was good but there was no response from the TCL company and the installation was done from our side . Delivery boys said that technicians will be arriving for a installation and a demo but unfortunately Sorry . It's almost a week completed. But the product is Good and the clarity and the sound system was Awesome . Only disappointment with technical Assistance.",Nice but need a assistance,B07TNVR737
Mine has issue with software i guess. It's unable to play 4k content from HDD and none of the files working from usb port. It plays video file just voice no display. Display turns into green. All this started after 15days of purchase and I couldn't able to return also because return window is closed. Now I have to struggle to fix this issue. Not worth it. Better to by good brands even though it is bit expensive.,"What we pay for that's what we get, not worth it.",B07TNVR737
"Have been using for eleven days. So far it has proved to be a good product. Though Amazon fixed an installation date ten days after delivery, I called up TCL and it was installed the very next day. The only issue was that the installation agent's technician was in a rush and finished the ""demo"" in 5 mins asking us to read the manual for the rest. The manual is OK but not very good. Of course, I should be able to get a hang of features not yet used by us such as mobile phone mirroring and voice instructions into the remote but that takes time which I haven't yet been able to devote. I guess the ball is in my court only.",More than value for money.... it's a steal.,B07TNVR737
"Being smart android TV, there must be all apps. Jio TV and amazon prime video apps are not compatible with this. Please provide a solution to install or access these two apps on this TV. If additional USB fire stick is required, please deliver that to same delivery address without additional charges. This is not good to not to declare that these two apps are not in TCL android play store.",JIO TV and amazon prime video app,B07TNVR737
amazing product in this range. some customers are review that amazon prime video is missing but you can download it from google play.,amazing product,B07TNVR737
"Ordered during diwali sale. Bought for 46k or so. Received promptly. Installation was done by team of 2 people in professional way. Been 2 days since i have started using. 2 stars less since amazon prime video is not yet supported. Customer service could not say by when will it be supported. Using Google Chrome to use it for now. Smart tv not having natuve support for such leading platform is bad. Have bought TCL 49 inch earlier, ljked it and hence bought 1 more but this time smart tv. Picture. It's very good if watching 4k video. Your internet speed should be good for 4k video. Eae it will pause due to buffering. HD channels should be good. Haven't yet connected tata sky hd+. Difficult to compare with others sincebmost showrooms tune tv which they want to push in best setting mode. I am happy with pictures so far. Audio Typically LED tv have bad audio output due to lack of depth i. Speaker. This TV has better audio compared to my 49 inch non smart TCL TV. am using SONY RT3 sound bar so dont care about tv audio. For decent audio, spending 10 to 20k on homr theater orbspund bar is highly recommended. Other Bezels are really slim. Looks great. Option of turning off white light strip when tv is off is well thought, since i dont like such lights during night especially if you use it in bedroom. Need to figure out how to play games with gamepad. Wall mount is very good and sturdy. Go and buy it since its best value for money.",Good value for money. Amazon prime not supported,B07TNVR737

Besides it is very complicated to use or add input system , one of my hard drive of one TB got corrupted due settings . I am trying to get technician to get that port checked.

This TV is generating very nice blacks. Don't know-how. At this price point this TV is No Brainer. Just grab it. Pros Nice Blacks. Rich Colors Micro dimming works. Cons Remote has lagged. 4k videos on youtube are glitchy.,The contrast ratio is super. Deep blacks,B07TNVR737
"Delivered in 1 day and installation same day. Picture quality is great and sound quality is awesome, sound bar is not required. SD chanells quality is also good. Amazon prime is not certified so all features wont work properly. Other apps will run smoothly. Airtel x stream and jio tv app is not available for this tv which is a drawback.

I had been using another version of 55 inches outside India and have been satisfied with the performance and experience. My parents are glad with the HD quality and sound, no frills attached.

"Intially I was very apprehensive of buying a TCL brand, but after doing lot of R&D, I decided to go for TCL 43KP8. Let me start with the packing, it was intact and was pleased to see, the way they had packed it. I brought this from my local dealer, because this model wasn't available in Croma and other big retailers. The local dealer helped me installed it the very next day. Its just been 2 days, however, so far its been impressive. I'll directly move to Pros and Cons Pros - Good clarity User friendly Awesome sound, you dont need a home theater after this good features as well Cons: little bulky from behind slow response time when you move from one channel to another Cant think of any",Feedback for TCL 43P8,B07TNVR737
"Bought this amazing 55 inch TCL TV P8 on 15th Oct from offline market , got it for 30k net including cash back, must say its excellent for its price, was delivered the same day and company technician came the next day,wall mounts, table top clamps, Manual, warranty card and audio video cable was included. My First thoughts - 1.Excellent Picture quality , plays 4K content flawlessly, good colors n brightness (4.5 out of 5) 2.Good clear sound, could be slightly better but cannot ask for more at this price, quite loud, at 30 volume it was sufficient for my 200 sqft living room (3.8 out of 5) 3.Android 9 with Netflix and YouTube preinstalled, installed Prime video, hotstar, zee5, altbalaji and others from Google play store, all worked fine , no issues there (4.7 out of 5) 4.Good build quality , voice command work perfectly, all necessary ports though location of those could be better (4.0 out of 5) Overall 4.4 out of 5, excellent value for money , in offline market we get 3yrs warranty instead of 1.5 yrs offered here so keep that in mind.","Excellent 4K 55inches TV, Good Buy",B07TNVR737
"Long Term Ownership: I would not really say long as I owned it for 2 years now. The TV functioning is good, no complains from this android TV. The TV panel started to give problem from 18-20 months. It would not show display immediately when turned on. Now the display itself is completely gone and need to be replaced. As you know the display is 80% of the cost. So it is not really a ideal scenario. Please consider going for a branded TV where there is warranty on the display as well.",Long Term Ownership,B07TNVR737

"I have bought this TV on 13th October 2019 for Rs. 47999. The picture clarity is too bad. This is 4KUHD TV but the picture clarity is equal to the LCD TV of the SONY. Because I have used Sony LCD TV for nearly 8 years. TCL 4KUHD screen is not TFT. Therefore the tubelight in my wall is appearing in the TV screen. Buy this 65inch TV if u have very big hall in ur house. The quality of the non HD channels are very worst. The audio quality is not good. The audio output is not gives 5.1 speaker channel digital effect. This TV gives the picture clarity of Projector based videos. We can't expect the picture clarity of Samsung, Sony TV. Don't expect much when u buy this TV.",Bad picture clarity,B07TNVR737

"The technician has done a horrible job as he has mounted the TV on the old Sony Bracket and has taken away the TCL bracket with himself. Now since the TV is not mounted well, I’m trying to reach out to the technician and he is not picking up the phone. His name is Raees and his number is 9930141608. This is truely horrible on amazon’s part to contract such guys. I want my TCL holder back",Horrible experience with Technician,B07TNVR737

Don't buy TCL products, its such a waste company. Plz amazon don't encourage these kind of company products. I want to give negative rating, but just to post this review I gave 1 rating","Plz dont buy TCL products, no customer service even during warranty period",B07TNVR737

"The Picture quality is good for the price of the TV. Now, for the problems I'm having. Not playing 4K content on Prime video. Only plays 1080p. Also, the app is slow and I had difficulty loggingnin to prime the first time I opened the app. I had to reinstall the prime app in order for login screen to appear. Also, my Bluetooth Xiaomi audio reciever keeps losing audio whenever TV is left idle for even a minute or when i switch over to another app. The TCL tcast remote android is buggy and it is impossible to enter text using the remote app. Edit - it’s December and prime video app has now disappeared from play store. It wasn’t very good before as it couldn’t play 4K content. Now, the app has disappeared altogether from the play store. Now, I have to side load the app to install. The TCL customer care keep saying prime video support will come after OTA software upgrade. Initially, it was supposed to come in October-end. It’s December now and still no OTA software upgrade which will bring prime video 4K support. Very disappointed with the software experience.",The software is buggy. Prime video not playing 4K video,B07TNVR737
"I never see this type of Fake product which is sold among the peoples . No picture Quality, No Bluetooth Connection, T-cast disconnected immediately while play the videos , 4K video not support . First this is not 4K TV. TCL cheat the peoples in the name of 4K UHD. Not worthy. This is completely LED tv only not 4K or UHD . Don't believe this product and I sure TCL never answer this Why 4K videos not supported ,Only 1080p videos only supported. Total money waste",Worst Product Cheat TCL- Fake Product,B07TNVR737
