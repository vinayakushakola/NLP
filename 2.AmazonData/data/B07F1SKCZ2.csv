"Got this tv during diwali sale for 27K. At this price point one can't ask for more. Picture quality is at par. Some comments have mentioned about sound problem. I don't think so. Sound is pretty much normal. And one can always connect to external speakers. 43 inches TV at this price, total value for money. No issues. Delivery was on time and same day Samsung guy came and installed it. With this tv you get mounting clamps inside.",Total Value for Money. Picture quality at par.,B07F1SKCZ2
This product is a basic model as told by samsung engineer ....First the delivery itself was a big mess....it was marked as delivered on 31 october but it was not delivered till nov 7th ....then when it was delivered the guys did not know it was for exchange....then installation took 2 more days.... There is a blurness with the picture quality ....when enquired the samsung engineer said it is due to the d2h quality ...so please note that when you are buying this ...you need to have hd d2h box else the picture quality will be blurred...on top of it the sound quality is very poor.... Samsung engineer itself told that because it is priced less this tv is not so good.....so please think twice before purchasing this...,This is the basic model of samsung with low quality...,B07F1SKCZ2
"Got defective product, there was no display at all. Seller should check before dispatching the product. Bad experience.",Defective product Received.,B07F1SKCZ2
Bought Samsung 43 inch LED about 5 months back....TV stopped working due to some internal fault . It's been 1.5 months since then and my TV even being within Warranty hasn't been replaced or repaired. Now Service Centre people are saying they will give vouchers using which we can purchase another TV and those vouchers are not even redeemable in my city. The Service Centre people are also asking for additional 600 Rs as we don't have the TV box with us. This is very ridiculous after sales Service of Samsung. I will post this message across all social media platforms so no one falls prey of such ridiculous service. I am also filing case in consumer court to get refund of my television and for the mental stress had to go through because of this.,Ridiculous experience with Samsung,B07F1SKCZ2
Broken tv,I have got broken tv,B07F1SKCZ2
"Worst picture quality, If u dnt hv any prior experience of LEDs go for it bt if u know how pictire quality of LEDs is supposed to be. Dnt get trapped seeing brand Samsung & low Price of This Tv, its a trash, pixels break & very poor quality of Display. Returned it after few days of testing.",Very poor picture quality,B07F1SKCZ2
"Seems like a minor mistake from product team.. the video/pics are differnt that specifications and actual product is a old version.. it is NOT A smart TV. Not worth 30K for sure. Besides.. Amazon's customer service team is just another maze run.. and open loop.. you will be running in circles, pathetic service teams.. instances like these bring out the loose ends and if not fixed they become a reason. Amazon needs to learn this.. loose ends is fine, today's technology enabled customers understand, what we dont is misleading, unwillingness to fix the issue, blame game and 17th century customer skills. DO NOT BUY !!!",Seems like a minor mistake,B07F1SKCZ2
THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION DOES NOT MATCH THE VIDEO ATTACHED. THE VIDEO DEMONSTRATION SHOWS A SMART TV FEATURES ETC BUT REALLY THE TV IS JUST A NORMAL TV. DONT BE FOOLED BY THE VIDEO,WRONG DESCRIPTION,B07F1SKCZ2
Product design is good but the picture quality of full HD is very bad. MP4 not supporting,The Picture Quality of SD & HD both are same.,B07F1SKCZ2

It looks good. But the most appalling part on the part of Samsung as well as amazon is they don't give you the copy of the warranty .. I called the customer care they say it is.not being given for some products. This is so appalling. If tom there is a dispute how will I claim warranty ? Irresponsible by Samsung and amazon. Technitian says 2 years warranty of all. How will I know the period of warranty without the info being given ! Worst,Warranty,B07F1SKCZ2
Didn't expect such a quality product at reasonable price. Amazon made our day by providing what we exactly looking for. Super fast delivery and good response from Installation persons. Nowadays really stand is no where bothered and not using at all.. Persons who are looking only for quality HD view can go for it we brought it for our parents where they are looking only for quality dish views. And offcouse Pendrive options and access to ports are very easy since there are kept side ways. Thanks guys for understanding our requirements and making us feel that we made right choice!!.. thanks Amazon and thanks Samsung,Value for money and worth buying it!!,B07F1SKCZ2
"TV's display is a big let down. The LED is very dimly lit and the colors are so inaccurate that it can't differentiate with grey & black, while and offwhite. I don't the how other products perform in this price range but this product definitely will not satisfy the quality you would expect from a TV.",Very dim and inaccurate color display,B07F1SKCZ2

It was told that wall mount bracket is included but when I received the product wall mount bracket was not there,Wall mount bracket not found,B07F1SKCZ2
Bought it on Amazon Great Indian Festival at 30k with 1k cashback also..means 29k. Picture quality is superb..design is eligant...sound quality I felt not at par with contemprories like LG..can be improved.But still very good. Got Amazon fire stick with that 1k cashback applied..nd it cost Rs1900 only. So basically I got a full jd tv of 43inch at 29k nd changed it to smart tv in 2k only ..VALUE F9R MONEY.,VALUE FOR MONEY.,B07F1SKCZ2
"Only 2months of using TV, stopped working, got problem in mother board. Brand telling need to replace mother board, Picture quality is too bad. Need improvements in sound quality.

This is first time i am writing a review for product i purchased.. Picture quality is too bad.. I exchanged my 10 years old toshiba 32 inch LCD TV with this.. Now i regret.. Because that TV was far better than this Samsung HDTV. Speakers are also not as I expected.. I wanted to return this product but they refused.. So I have to suffer with this for next 1 year at least..😂 😂,Overall Genuine Review..,B07F1SKCZ2
The 14 watt sound output was way below expectations. Had to upgrade the output with the Boat Avante soundbar. The picture quality is also on the duller side but that should pass for a majority of users.,A 'B grader' all the way,B07F1SKCZ2
"Amazing TV at this price from Samsung with 3 HDMI ports, solving my problem to have DTH, fire stick and my PS3 to be plugged in at the same time... great on time delivery by Amazon and then an installation by Samsung within 4 hrs of delivery.. great experience all across",Value for Money,B07F1SKCZ2

Sound is not clear.... More noise,Sound is not good,B07F1SKCZ2
Kindly if you are planning for the purchase of TV. Follow these points:- 1) Always check the ratio of Length and height which should lie in and around the ratio of 1.414. 2) Do not get blind by seeing the larger inch in cheap price. 3) Sony Bravia is always a better choice.,how to purchase a TV,B07F1SKCZ2

"When my 10 years old Samsung LCD started giving problem for last 2 months, was looking out for a non-smart branded TV (For branded I mean - LG, Sony, Samsung and Panasonic). And this one fits perfectly. This is good for 1. Available space or requirement is only 43 inch, so 4K/UHD does not make sense in this size. Full HD it is. 2. Smart features not required as you prefer to use media hub/player like nvidia shield tv, fire tv stick, AVR setup etc 3. Need a branded TV with proper service network 4. Don't want to spend much, as TV viewing is minimal but need a TV for living room's decor 5. You need both brand and budget 6. Prefer to wall mount Do not buy this when 1. You need ARC (audio return channel) as you don't have media hub or AVR 2. You need a smart TV as you do not have a media player 3. You want to use HDMI link/CEC 4. Need super image quality like 4k, HDR etc 5. You need 120hz panal (this is 60hz) 6. You do not want to wall mount and prefer table top. Now, overall a good tv with decent picture quality, no light bleeding or any other issues - whole screen is evenly lit. Has 3 HDMIs and a USB. USB gives only .5A power so you cannot power your chromecast/fire tv stick from it. Supports playing movies and songs from usb. Menu/Settings give minimum options to tweak. Misses out ARC and CEC. Sound is as usual like other TVs. If you want to watch movies invest at least on a decent sound bar. Really value for money; when on offer/cashback/discount if you buy this and spend on a Amazon Fire Tv stick, it saves minimum 5k~7k from a cheapest branded smart TV. Comes with basic wall mount inside box. Thin bezel, looks good on wall. Highly recommended.","Best 43inch non-smart LED TV available across brands, Value for money, good looks, wall mount inside",B07F1SKCZ2
Value for money. Best budget TV in recent time. Best video performance and aspect able audio effect. Thanks to Amazon for offering a Cashback Offer for this amazing product. GET 15% CASHBACK + 6 Month Extended Warranty In this Product by Ordering through vqr .in/b Hope this helps! If helped then Please Press the Helpful Button. Happy Purchasing,STOP STOP !!! READ MY REVIEW OR BLOW YOUR MONEY,B07F1SKCZ2
I found a defective product (there is a blue line across the screen) and the picture quality is not acceptable. Doesn’t produce or effectively render the HD quality; may whatever HD settings you choose! This product didn’t come with a TV stand but came only with wall mount equipment set. Would recommend not to buy this product.,Product no good,B07F1SKCZ2
no Extra Option . sound is poor . quality is too poor . Waste Money,Waste of money,B07F1SKCZ2
"I bought this TV for 21k after discounts for using SBI card ,exchange and great Indian sale .at that price this TV is a must buy.it comes only with wall mount as expected.",Satisfied,B07F1SKCZ2
I think this is good tv but picture quality is very poor and voice is very low and never buy Samsung product.,Bad experience,B07F1SKCZ2
"Great TV for this price range n size. I got this TV for 25990 with 2 consecutive discounts on the sale day. It's not a smart TV but who cares, just plug a Amazon fire TV stick if u demand for one. The picture quality is great, same as the Sony TV I own. Sound is on the lower side, u may opt for an external speaker to enhance that. Got the TV wall mounted by the Samsung guys within 48hrs of delivery as promised. If u want a good brand good TV under 30k,this is it",Great TV,B07F1SKCZ2
Good,Nice buy,B07F1SKCZ2
Best TV in lower price . Good picture quality. good service . Thanks Amazon and Samsung,Best,B07F1SKCZ2
"Side view colours faded, sound is clear",Value for money,B07F1SKCZ2
"PLease don't fall into this marketing gimmick. Its not HD TV, its just 720p which is not Full HD and you will NOT be able to have HD experience. Its so shame, companies making people fool by writing HD ready: ""Resolution: HD Ready (1366x768p)"" Whereas the resolution is: 1366x768p not 1080p, Read the above statement carefully, it's written in description and its a way to make people fool. Actual the ""HD"" word means: 1080p and less than this is not HD, less then 1080p is just partial HD and if you get this TV and watch it with any DTH HD: you will not be able to watch good crisp HD picture, nor it will give any good experience with Amazon Fire TV stick and Netflix. Ultimately any TV which says: Resolution: HD Ready (1366x768p) is trash so stay away from it!",It's NOT HD - Do not Buy it,B07F1SKCZ2
The picture quality is awesome but the sound quality is worst.,Worth buying,B07F1SKCZ2
There is no stand for tv inside the box and plz arrange for the stand,Tv stand not available,B07F1SKCZ2
"Amazon delivery service is the worst ever in this world. I ordered this TV ,delivery boys came with the TV and took it back , because their card reader machine was not working how disheartened. Whole family was waiting for TV and delivery boys were so illeletrate that don't how to start card reader machine and connect even the account they were using to log in was of different person. TV ka sapno tod diya amazon walo ne. Now we have decided to delete amazon prime account.",Amazon delivery service is the worst.,B07F1SKCZ2
The picture quality is good. But connectivity options are poor. It doesn't have an HDMI arc to connect high definition audio players or speakers. It's an outdated version.,Very less connectivity options,B07F1SKCZ2
"Listed at ₹34k as I write this review, good deal to consider the specs and screen size of 43 inches. Bought it from local Samsung dealer costing me around ₹2.5k more than today's offer here. However got Samsung 2.1 speakers bundled with it as part of Independence day offer. It is non-smart TV with 3 HDMI and 1 USB & VGA port. Only point to consider is the sound output which is only 14 W, which can be easily enhanced using any home theatre or speakers you may have.",Good Deal within 43 inch screen size,B07F1SKCZ2
Don't buy samsung 5100 model as they have back light failure issue after 3-4 years. Every year this problem comes and u have to pay around 5k for repairing cost.,Faulty tv,B07F1SKCZ2
All good.,Good one,B07F1SKCZ2
This tv is an old model tv i.e2016. It does not come with modern interface.its picture quality is very poor and sound too. I have requested samsung to replace it with new 2018 samsung tv .But they are just making me fool.So never buy this tv .,Worst tv i ever used,B07F1SKCZ2
Contrast is OK. Colors are really nice. Sound quality is good. Remote quality is great. Good response. What else one can expect at this price?,True value for money,B07F1SKCZ2
"Buyers, please understand this is a basic LED TV, and please expect only that much features. Though it's a basic one, it delivers it's value for this cost... Overall, a good upgrade for the old picture tube users...",It's good starter..,B07F1SKCZ2
Great picture quality at an amazing price! Had wanted to wall mount and that's what I got! Else every TV comes with a stand which is wasted and keeps lying in the box! Helped save money for additional item (table stand) which is generally not utilized! Similar model in retail store is Rs. 4K more!,Simply Amazing!,B07F1SKCZ2
Picture quality is awesome. It plays almost all format videos from USB. The only drawback is sound. Even at full volume it does not meet the need. You definitely need an external speakers.,Sound Quality is poor.,B07F1SKCZ2
Television is for all u see by DTH and that TV fullfill all our requirement. The great picture quality us imagining and we attach home theatre in it which made sound quality superb,HD LED TV is good....no need to buy smart TV,B07F1SKCZ2

"Never Buy a Samsung TV product. I just got a 40K5570 Model an year ago for 57000 Rupees. Just after 3 months, the power box failed and the display went off. The customer care of Samsung is sick. I have to pay another 15000 rupees now to get it all repaired. The poorest response from customer care as well. They will charge you 1000 rupees just for engineer visit to check the problem.
