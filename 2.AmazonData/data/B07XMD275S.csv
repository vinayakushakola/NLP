"Though it is android TV comes with pre-installed PRIME VIDEO and other Video apps, Prime video and other apps are getting crashed. i have raised complaint to Amazon to troubleshoot the issue and their technician has reported that TV has issues without showing-up to my house . i've also contacted VU customer service, they said this model has issue. i really had bad experience with amazon service. the lesson i learnt is buy it from your local shops around you, instead of going through this hardship. Zero Star for their valuable service. i don't thing Amazon will post my review.",Beware of VU Ultra Android TV,B07XMD275S
"So, bought this TV during the recent Great Indian sale. 1) This TV is apt for viewing distance of 10-15 feet - Comes with the wall mount. 2) The picture quality and sound is actually good - Not attaching images as I am not good with photography. 3) Pre-installed apps are working fine (Netflix/Zee5/Hotstar/the usual runners). 4) Play store provides ample other options. What's not working: 1) So, this probably is a Amazon Prime issue. I am not sure (need to call Amazon) but my Prime is not working. Like the device is registering to my account however when I try to play the video - I get a msg to go to amazon.com/videohelp. Which really is not helping. I can cast via my phone though so I guess, it's not a complete dead end. 2) Phone mirroring works however lags by a few seconds. Overall, a must buy at the discounted price that I bought it - INR 18k. Final word, a big thank you to the installation team. Missed the first schedule (understandable during sale season) however, second run wasn't a Miss and the guy was good. No hassle and polite.",When a woman reviews,B07XMD275S
Nice as under 12k. Will update review and share once use for six months .as I seen it's required proper 4g speed which not available in india at all locations even in metro.,Nice as per price,B07XMD275S
TV installation completed after 12 days... It's disappointed us as the service is poor... But the quality of the TV is very good... Smart TV functionally I didn't check. I will update after using some months. Blindly go for this brand if you need a better one with in your budget price. This is my third VU TV purchase for my family members.,Very good TV brand with a average service...,B07XMD275S
"Amazon gave false commitment stating Amazon prime will work while buying tv, but now customer support team said prime video won't support in the tv",Amazon prime not supported in this TV,B07XMD275S
Good but Amazon prime doesn't work with the inbuilt app. Also some inbuilt app force close themselves. Buggy software. Update: There was an update to the software. Amazon prime is working now. Good quality TV with super clarity and colour reproduction.,Good,B07XMD275S
The delivery was on time ...but NO one came for installation ... No one called ... Coming to voice - its low ... Amazon prime video - if you are a paid member - still doesn't work ... Called amazon - according to them we need to wait for the update only then it will work - and they dont know when the update will be released... Pretty unhappy with this buy ...,Unhappy,B07XMD275S
This tv is good sale if you get during great indian sale with exchange...bank discount ...with Amazon pay balance 1000 cashback.... Everything is good ...only one thing missing is voice search.... I have installed android remote control and connect with Bluetooth option..Google voice search works fine....,Nice tv with latest.,B07XMD275S
"Tv is with me, no installation from past 2 days. No proper timeline and response also. Now installation done. But coming to tv look and working, it’s simply awesome. Prime also working after reset/update tv os. Cool tv and best budget in this price. Voice option remote could be better.",Too much delay in installation,B07XMD275S
"The company is duping customers.. pls never buy VU TV..plus never buy white goods from Amazon during festive sale..their installation team will ruin your zeal by keeping installation pending for one month and then making item non returnable. PL use only brand arranged installation and not Amazon home services one. Actually, without Google voice assistant feature on its remote, it is not fully Android smart TV.. we have to struggle a lot for search icon.",Poor quality by VU TV,B07XMD275S

"Well for starters the complete playstore is not available. I could not even find Google Chrome but yes the picture quality is excellent and the sound too has become quite good since my first Vu TV. Overall a very good buy. So what exactly did I do for it to work. Firstly stop all updates. Not even system update cause the screen just stays put and nothing gets installed. Next step was to start installing desirable apps & to me the first I needed was a file explorer & a browser I found in playstore by searching just those words. Once that was done I did a system update. Now I can run any App bit Prime Video. When I try to log in it says can't login register on Prime ideo/MyTV. When I give the hashkey provided it says registration successful but on seeing devices registered this TV won't be found. So basically a dead end. Casting is slow but you need to only cast prime video else everything else can be side loaded. That is search for the app on your phone and install it via USB using file explorer. Yes Thope TV, Oreo TV, Typhoon TV, etc will work seamlessly. So basically it is not so simple but once you do everything falls in place. Would I recommend it? Damn well I will for at this price you get an excellent screen, sound again is very good & almost any Android App can be installed. No not Jio TV. I can see only half the screen! Update... Well when folks from VuTv called for feedback I did tell them about the Amazon Prime issue. The caller noted it down and sent me a PDF file containing the solution. It was upgrading OS to a Sep release & doing a reset. Now I had installed Apps & was wary of doing a reset. Now they called again to check if I had done the update or needed help. I said I hadn't done but they said everything would be fine. So I did a reset and was able to login to Amazon Prime & it worked. Also the sluggishness of casting got solved. So I am upgrading the rating to 5 stars from 4...",Thumbs up!! Upgrading to 5 stats,B07XMD275S
"Purchased less than a week. Prime video is not working. I buy this from Amazon as a prime member yet prime video doesn't work. I need this to be fixed. Have registered a complaint today. Netflix, Hotstar works well.",Amazon Prime does not work,B07XMD275S
"Amazing Build Quality ,picture and sound and software is a little bit messy at first because Amazon Prime will not work ,so what i did was contacted VU Technical Support and they have released an update of 852 mb.Now you should install that update and once again check Amazon Prime,if the problem persists you should factory reset your smart TV.This will automatically updates the old version to new version and Amazon prime will work Flawlessly. Google chromecast works fine nothing to worry about.casted a Amazon prime video (when inbuilt app was not working ) for about 3 hours without issue Need to check Netflix and Kodi and keep you posted.",Amazon Prime will work with an Update,B07XMD275S
"1) Color and brightness, overall display is very good 2) Wifi connectivity is excellent 3) If you want to enable 1080p display, you need to turn on both ""Game Mode & PC Mode"" in advanced video option. 4) Sound quality is very good when you turn on ""DTS-StudioSound"" in sound option. 5) Amazon Prime, Hotstar and Netflix can watch without any issues after update of Android. But the wifi net should be high-speed to enjoy the High quality streaming. Overall a very best TV in this price. I give 4.5 star out of 5.",Best TV with 1080p display,B07XMD275S

Sound & picture quality good.. New brand VU.. Great features in this price range.. Amazon delivery & installation is good (On Time) Competitive quality Against MI TV.,Best on this price,B07XMD275S
Bought a 43 inch variant as I needed a secondary tv. It's been a week now and I'm totally satisfied with the purchase. Was a bit disappointed when amazon prime refused to sign me in even after multiple attempts. Did some research and reset the tv from home screen - settings and wolla! Prime works like a charm now. Good buy for the price point. Extended warranty of 2 yrs is available through vu for a very reasonable price!,Good buy,B07XMD275S
Amazon and VU trying to fool the customers. The advertisement for this TV having Amazon prime everywhere but it won't work on this TV.,Why Amazon,B07XMD275S
Quality of the TV is nice and has very good options in this low cost. I am unable to sign in the pre-installed prime video app and when asked the prime video support team they informed me that currently VU tv is not supported for Prime Video. Then why the amazon advertising the prime video app with the main picture of the tv and with pre-installed app. Useless app finally...,Good Quality and nice options...,B07XMD275S

"Avoid buying from amazon Vu 43"" ultra android tv is a good buy at 21k and value for money, the picture quality and sound quality are good at this price. Also it comes with stock Android 9. The only issue which I have faced is prime video not working properly (which resolved through an update by proactive support from vu customer care) though has separate option in remote and mentioned in offering. It also sometimes responds a bit slow to remote actions. Unless you are ok with spending hours explaining issues to Amazon customer care executives one after another don't buy it from amazon, supposedly there is a large appliance customer care team which, as per my experience, is pathetic. Sharing the issues I have faced so that you are well aware of challenges when you buy any large appliance from Amazon: Installation: The installation guy has not come at the scheduled slot with no information. I was supposed to keep waiting for him. Once the waiting time (1.5 hours) is over I had to spend 3 hours explaining the issue to Amazon customer care, with no resolution. Supposedly there are different teams and call will get transferred to different executives and keep waiting on music (you would be asked to receive a call back from chat executive) and explaining the issue again and again. Finally, they told me they are unable to help. Installation guy came to my place 10 days after the tv delivery. Warranty: Though there was free extended warranty from acko as per the offer when I bought the tv. I have not recieved any information regarding the same. I had contacted Amazon customer care regarding the same and again faced the same pattern. After spending one hour ten mins explaining the issue to different executives I was asked to call again after few hours. Knowing the final response and the hastle I have to go though with Amazon large appliance customer care, I have decided to forget about the extended warranty. I believe a good number of frustrated customers may not follow up for warranty.",Vu ultra Android TV is good but don't buy from amazon,B07XMD275S
"Very happy to see its performance. Trust me it has Outstanding picture quality and inbuilt surround sound. Highly recommend to new buyer. This was 2nd time i purchase vu. 1st one is 3yr old and this recently in oct'19. Reviewed after 4day usage. New buyer don't worry if sound seems echo, pls change setting & u'll get clear sound from speaker. Installation service is pathetic.

"Purchased during recent Great Indian Sale (40 Inches), Pros: 1. Excellent Picture Quality with Full HD. 2. Sound Quality is quite sufficient for a large living room. 3. Wide viewing angle. 4. 5 Start Power consumption. 5. Most of the paid subscription Apps works after the initial firm ware upgrade. 6. Built-in dedicated Keys helps in switching to apps with ease. Cons: 1. Remote or TV doesn't support voice commands, requires an additional device. 2. Typing with remote is a bit awkward, QWERTY keypad on remote would help a lot.",Excellent Choice,B07XMD275S

"Best High end android TV in this range. Android 9 OS Hotkeys for Netfix, prime, YouTube & Google Play (though Amazon prime is having login issue). Picture quality is very good even without 4K screen. Sound quality is also good. No issue faced till now in connectivity ( WiFi, Bluetooth or USB all works absolutely fine). Absolutely flawless screen cast from mobile. Patch wall is simple and easy to use. Around 5GB free internal memory. So far so Good.. Customer case is little slow but OK. No smart remote.

Awesome Display with good brightness and clarity. Placed as second TV in bedroom and it has very nice stereo speakers with awesome sound and watching movies was fun with clear dialogues. First VU TV and its very impressive. As Usual amazon is the best when it comes to delivery and products. Box contains wall mount as well as stand. The Display panel is what impress me the most.

"Firstly the installation team sucks. No one came for installation until 4 days after the delivery. I would give zero stars for installation. The product is amazing, it's pure androidTV and like everyone else,i too got trouble with Amazon prime video. I just called VU support and their executive came to my home and upated the tv software.

Can't side load apps (i didn't find options yet ) . At this price range what you expect ;). *The biggest spoiler for VU is that Amazon handles the install services very poorly ,it took a week to get this installed (since DIY install void warranty) .At first it was Amazon app giving error to book slots,afterthat It takes 48+hrs fot site visit.*",Value for money but poor Amazon install service,B07XMD275S

"TV is exceptionally good. The picture clarity is excellent. I have one issue though, and that is if sound. The spoken voices in movies are very less audible and the background music is almost twice loud at same volume. If i want to hear the dialogues properly, then the music score blasts through the TV. Can someone help me with this ? Tried almost all settings. Will give 5 star if problem is solved.",VU TV Review,B07XMD275S
"Pro 1.Sound volume is good but quality is not. 2.Ease of Connectivity is good. 3. Picture Brightness and Contrast are good when viewed right from front (90deg) 4. Composite ports and USB ports responding well but USB 1 is not recognised. Cons 1. Disappointing point is the picture quality when vied from an angle.Against claims of 178deg viewing angle, the quality goes on deteriorating as the angle increases and at 178deg it is bad. 2.The operating Manual is too concise. Just passing mention about Chromecast, Bluetooth etc and if one is not already some sort of an expert, it will be difficult. Overall Fair quality. Value for money.",Overall good,B07XMD275S
"This review is edited after about a week of use. Good picture quality, decent sound quality. Best of all, excellent value for money esp with the exchange of my old TV. Earlier, I had Netflix, YouTube working fine but I had mentioned that Amazon Prime I wasn't able to sign in, due to some bug. I got an email from Vu detailing the procedure to ensure that Amazon Prime also works. I had to reset to default settings, but after that Amazon Prime has also started working. So all is fine now The delivery was on time, but the installation was delayed by about a week and took several follow ups. But was finally done well.",Very good,B07XMD275S
Good picture quality & fast installation,Wealth of mony,B07XMD275S
"The TV is competitively priced with attention to detail in design. An example is during the installation, I noticed that they have taken good care that in a case of wall mount, the mount does not damage the wall & hence some cushion has been provided along. The only which could be improved is the speed. I felt the TV was a bit slower as compared to my other TV although this does not affect the viewing experience & Hotstar takes a long time to load. I am not sure if this is specific to my TV but nothing major as well. Overall a good product in affordable price. I had issues with the installation from Amazon & after escalation, VU themselves made sure the TV is installed on time & checked with me if I am satisfied with the service. That is a really great after sales experience not so common across other brands I use. The person from VU who did the installation was also extremely good & had a good understanding with the installation. The Picture & sound quality is no doubt good for the price. Overall a very pleasant experience so far.",A TV worth the money,B07XMD275S
"The amazon prime issue is solved by doing a factory reset of the tv. This Tv has decent build quality, picture quality and most of the features you would require factoring in the price you pay. However, what bothers me the most is the poor sound quality. It distorts with a jarring effect whenever there is any sound with bass in it, for example background music, loud noises etc. This happens not only on high volume but on low volume as well as well. The sound comes off as boxy and annoying. Have tried different sound setting as well but can't seem to resolve the issue. Not sure if this problem is being faced by everyone or for my tv alone hence am going to ask for a replacement. Update 1: The Technician that Amazon sent to check the TV has now confirmed that there is a functional problem with the sound of the TV and it needs to be replaced. However, after many phone calls with Amazon customer care they are now telling me that the option to replace the TV is not appearing in their backend system and there is only an option for initiating a refund. However, a refund is not the solution for me as the price for the same model has now gone up by 1500/- on Amazon (from the same seller, Cloudtail), so I can't repurchase the same model at the price I paid. All this while they were assuring me that the TV would be replaced if a fault was found but are now saying that they can only refund the amount paid as the TV is not in stock with the vendor. This is not true as it is still available on the Amazon site through the same vendor albeit at a higher price i.e. 19999/- (instead of 18499/-, which is the amount I paid for it). Since all of this is no fault of mine I do hope they are able to resolve this issue amicably without further delay Update 2: Finally received a replacement for the TV a few days back. But was suspicious as it did not come in the type of packaging as the first TV I received (no protective plastic covering on the outside of the box). Once the technician opened the box to install the same we found out it was a used TV as there was no protective plastic covering the TV inside the box as well, the TV was just placed inside the box with the accessories. The remote batteries were already inside the remote and once the TV was switched on it went directly to the viewing screen without going through any setup. Add to all this the sound issue persisted in this TV as well so had no option but to return the same for a refund. Please be aware that Amazon is recirculating these TVs and hence their customers must make sure that they are infact receiving a new/unused piece. This has been one of the few times I've had a bad experience with Amazon but hopefully they look into the matter.",Very poor sound quality and used TV given as replacement,B07XMD275S

"The product is very good ... delivery was prompt by Amazon as usual !! The picture quality as well as sound quality is pretty good for the price and the Smart TV features work well !! The latest Android pie as the OS delivered a smooth experience, the TV remote is responsive and having direct buttons for Netflix, Prime Video, YouTube, Hotstar as well as Google Play helps immensely. Bluetooth connectivity is a boon for connecting wireless headphones etc, Casting your phone works pretty well ... etc. etc. Lot of good features that I found useful. I did compare many similar TV's before buying this one, and am not at all disappointed with my decision till date. I would have loved to have 3 HDMI connections, but that is only a minor miss I would say. This is not my main TV (that is a bigger and high-end TV) so I am not comparing the two, I have a fair understanding and appreciation of AV, hence in my judgement this is a very good TV at this price point (maybe better than some products at a little higher price points than this. I would recommend !!",Very good quality and feature rich TV for the price !,B07XMD275S

"The whole experience with the TV is really good. Amazing picture clarity and sound output is commendable. All the apps works perfectly except Prime Video which is a bummer. Amazon says that the TV is not supported. Not sure why they advertise that it support Prime Video. VFM product if you don't mind the issue with Prime Video. *****Edit***** Changing my rating to 5 Stars. Prashanth from VU called me up and said that the issue should be fixed by updating the software to the latest version. I updated to the latest one (Sept 16th release). It still didn't work.

"When I purchased it, I was facing trouble in casting tv with my phone, and zee5 was not working properly, But both problems resolved with first software update. + video quality is good, the sound is loud and clear. UI is good. The problems I can see now is: Half star lost here. 1. The missing feature is: no mic/ voice button on remote + voice feature does not work, you can only type key by key using remote which is very hectic thing, when you could just speak and get things types on screen. Below mentioned 2 points are negligible and can be ignored or might be fixed in upcoming releases. 2. amazon prime not working, but this is working in the Casting feature. 3. sound is a little distorted when we surf/move between apps, only that sound is distorted, tv sound is awesome. Build quality- half star lost here. 4. The screen is not 100% fit and taped on corner boundary, I can see light coming out at some places standing parellet to screen, this point I am not considering since we have paid half the price of LG/ Samsung haha. I got this 40-inch device in 18500, 1000 amazon pay cashback I got and 1850 I will get in SBI bank account cashback, So I got it for 15650 :) + plus point is, got both stands with TV, MItv does not wall mount stand, so save of 400 Rs again. + got Acko 1 year extra warranty from Amazon because of Big festival Sale. Earlier I was confused because of a few above points, but casting resolved half of my doubts :) You can buy it without much doubt.",only voice button mic feature is missing in remote,B07XMD275S

"Brought Vu premium and Vu UltraAndroid for myself and relatives so here's my short summary. Before getting into the positive I just want to point out the one con i found so far which is the lack fo 3.o Usb ports for the TV it comes with 2 USB 2.0 ports only. Now, Let's get into the picture quality ,the picture quality is really good with good brightness level and contrast. FHD channels looks pretty good too. i don't think you can beat this TV's picture quallity compared to other TVs on a budget, First thing you notice is how well it upscales Videos that are non FHD to look miles better. Espcially when there are still alot of Tv channels in SD,this upscaling feature alone makes the tv worthy along with picture quality. In terms of Android experience it's pretty much Stock android Pie tv experience with occasional lags here and there even high end Android TV's have this issue so not much to complain here. Tv comes with Netflix Amazon prime youtube and hotstar installed with first 3apps getting their own dedicated buttons on the remote . The picture quality through streaming is pretty good too. Coming to the sound quality i found it better then my mi soundbar and prefered to use inbuilt tv speaker.It's got good bass ,clarity and quite loud . Conclusion If you are looking mainly for the picture quality on a budget you should be better going of with this or the non Android VU Ultra Tv for 16k. IF you don't mind spending an extra few thousands you should consider getting the VU premium android 4k not that there are lot of 4k content, but even the FHD channels looks so much better in that tv its more vivid and black levels are deep. Streamed 4k videos though Youtube to my Vu premium the picture quality is great and got great details to it. For full detailed review i found Techiebeez india channel to have good review of this TV.",Probably the Best in-terms of Picture quality for Budget,B07XMD275S

"As a TV, it is a good buy. The picture and sound is good. TV design is good but its the software that is a let down. the resolution of home screen etc is a let down. Its not sharp at all. Netflix is working but we are unable to use AMAZON prime ( it is a built in app ). Its much better to buy VU Non Smart tv and purchase a Fire Stick or equi. While that was by earlier review. VU sorted out the problem almost immediately and they definitely deserve a mention and a pat on the back. Seems like my SMART TV is SMART once again. We are more than satisfied with the software now that all our grievance have to looked into. I would not only recommend the tv for the display and sound, but also VU as a brand that is Prompt in AFTER SALES.","Be Smart, Dont buy SMART... unless its a VU.",B07XMD275S
Pros: 1) Picture and Sound Quality is really Good a d besf for viewing at distance of 4 feet. 2) Android TV system UI operates smothly. 3) Got it in RS 10349 during sale and also got RS 1000 in amazon pay as Cashback so Its a value for money product. So good for starters. Cons: 1) There is no Google Voice Assistant in remote so this is a big problem for me. I have to use my phone using Android TV app downloaded from Play Store to use voice assistant using bluetooth (You can also use WiFi) but even it doesn't work well like I can't use it to search using voice on YouTube. Full review soon. Need fix in Android TV UI. 2) Dual core processor is not enough for this TV as it is slow in opening apps. 3) Screen sharing/mirroring lags using Redmi Note 5 Pro phone but my phone cast fine with laptop so its TV problem. My verdict: If you are tight on budget go for this TV as it has very good picture quality.,Good Picture and Sound Quality But Google Assistant is missing in Remote,B07XMD275S
"This TV has multiple issues. One needs to keep following up with customer service without any response. Bought it 5 days ago. 1. Constant system sound i.e. sound from the left right up down plus clicks is too annoying and there is no way it can be stopped. 2. Picture mode and sound mode buttons on remote so not work in tv mode. 3. TV remote response is slow and lags. Booting takes significant time as well Complaint raised but no updates so far. They accepted that these are the issues but that's how it is and no way out. 4. Cant return so you have to bear the 20k spent. 5. Picture quality is good. 6. Sound is loud but not clear and we end up putting it on very high volume. 7. Not user-friendly and not many apps on the Play Store. Not sure why they named it ultra android when there is nothing special about this android tv. 6. Colours fade when viewed from sides. I will update with other issues if found. Believe me I don't see any features in this tv apart from dedicated buttons on remote for few apps which will be useless if you have hdmi streaming and you can use voice search on jio, firestick etc",Multiple issues and Pathetic customer service,B07XMD275S
All features are excellent and truly amazing .it is really worth for money compared to the others in the same category.Picture and sound quality is superb,Excellent Tv with power packed features,B07XMD275S
"Picture superb and sound good. Brightness excellent. User interface easy to use. Remote response fast. Features like sleep and on timer working perfectly.build quality nice. Voice search missing on remote but downloaded android tv remote app (by Google) and connected with tv, now I have voice search as well as touchpad for scrolling and it is working superb. Don't like installation service but Amazon has taken steps to provide demo. Let me see what happens. Updated tv to the latest version. Amazon prime working smoothly. Chrome cast also working without any lag with google home app. Vu customer care is available for any help needed. Not tried play store yet.",Excellent quality. Go for it,B07XMD275S

"This TV was delivered to me on 6th & on 9th Oct the installation was done. All good so far. Happy with the sound & picture quality. Most of the Apps are working fine including Netflix. However I have problems connecting to Amazon Prime. Tried several times, entered the Code from the TV to my Amazon login on my computer. I get a success message on the computer but nothing happens on the TV. Tried calling the Amazon toll free no. but no person to speak with. If someone can help me with this would be highly appreciated. Sorry for the late update. Finally a service guy came to check my TV. Sat from 10:30 until 13:30. Tried several things including some downloads and restarts with no positive result. Promised to get back to me in 2 days. I did not hear from him for 4 days. Then I got a call from Mumbai VU who asked me to do certain updates on the TV. I asked him to call back the next day as I would be near the TV. He did call the next day and finally Amazon Prime started working on 6th Nov. (27 days after the TV was delivered). But I was happy. Then 2 days later the technician who came to my office called to say hes coming to fix the problem. I told him it was already sorted. All is well so far with the TV and its a good buy for the price. Cheers.",Good TV so far but cant connect Amazon Prime,B07XMD275S
If u r sign in into amazone prime and u r able to do the registration then its alright but if u r having a problem like the site ur registring on is showing its done but there is nthing happening on tv then first check for system update and after the update or if it is already up to date then perfom a factory reset. Done! Problem solved thk me later,Solution for amazon prime register problem....,B07XMD275S
"Well to begin with this is TV is absolutely steal at the current pricing. The only thing I found a bit off was the sound quality, the speech isnt clear enough. Should improve with the use of equalizers I suppose. But overall the look, video quality, sturdiness is pretty good. I find it worth to buy!",Perfect for its pricing,B07XMD275S
"The delivered product is what is shown on Amazon site. Price - Bought is for 15499 an Amazon Sale after cashback and discounts along with additional discount offer on FireTV stick Picture Quality - Great for HD content. Ok for SD content Sound Quality - It is loud. Have to teak sound settings as per your linking for clarity. A Decent soundbar can provide sound effects. Android Experience is great. Netflix, Hotstar and Amazon Prime works fine. Amazon Prime works great after factory reset. What is Missing is Google assistant Button on remote. Recommend to buy.","Value for Money, Works Great as per Expectations",B07XMD275S
"POOR QUALITY Product ! Calling it a poor quality product will be an UNDERSTATEMENT. Color quality, it's so slow, lags etc. This is what VU California is all about. Buying this is a WASTE of your hard earned money. Never recommend. This brand !",VU _ POOR QUALITY Product ! Calling it a poor quality product will be an UNDERSTATEMENT.,B07XMD275S
"In a word ""Fantastic""... Picture quality & sound is awesome. Worth every rupee. Highly recommended. A ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ product. The best part is that we can watch Netflix, Prime Video & YouTube at a click of a button since the remote control has all these buttons!! All works great. We are extremely happy with our purchase... Note. For all those people complaining about prime video & Netflix not working... You need to subscribe to both and login first... It works flawlessly..",Great TV experience!!,B07XMD275S
"The product details say it has prime video app. Can be seen on the remote too. However, it doesn't support prime video. Prime video does not work on this product. This should be clearly stated on the product details so the buyer knows what he is buying. Very disappointed with the product.",Wrong product details and specs,B07XMD275S
"Almost all the points were covered in other reviews from various customers. I don't want to repeat them again. Based on my usage from one week I felt picture clarity is very good, sound is also good. no need to separate speakers unless you want high woofer effects. I had faced issue with promevideo like many other users. I was able to resolve it by resetting the settings. Thanks for the solution by some users in the reviews section. Another issue which I am facing is with Jio cinema. I have installed the Jio Cinema app from the playstore. But I am not able to open the app. I am getting the error, unable to process the request, please try again later. Also I am not able to do casting also from jio cinema app from my mobile. I thought this issue also will be resolved after the system reset. But it didn't. If anybody is facing the similar issue and found any solution, please update. Apart from that all other apps are working fine. It is very good deal from amazon during the great Indian festival. I will add more points after exploring the product in detail.",Very smart for this price,B07XMD275S
"This is my first android tv and hope that I get a good experience using it for at least 6-7 years. My initial review is, picture and sound quality is good, wi-fi connectivity is also good, it is easier to setup, HD content is awesome, SD content with my IN cable setup box is ok. Overall a happy customer as I got it a good price.",Good tv with aggressive pricing,B07XMD275S
"1. Amazon Prime works fine on some occasions, but not able to store credentials, so again and again login is required. 2. On some occasions, composite video souce is not detected, so we have to give restart to tv, then it works. 3. Default source selection option is not available, so u need tv remote every time u need to watch your dish tv. Within two days vu support team visited the home and resolved almost all issues. Default input selection is not possible in this model, so keep TV remote along with cable TV remote. I am satisfied with the support and resolution.",Good tv with few setbacks,B07XMD275S
After 2 days of installation date. My TV doesn't working. Unacceptable issue,Bad Experience,B07XMD275S
"When I was booking this TV there was no ratings but now I could see plenty of negative comments, To be honest I do not know giving a positive rating at this juncture is correct or not as it is too early to judge/comment, but in my personal opinion on my last 2 days experience the product is very good for its price tag and the working features with the device. Secondly I've gone through all negative reviews and compared it with my TV, unfortunately none of them are valid, Prime is perfectly registered and we finished watching 2 full movie as well. But yes couple of vital things are missing ""Mic enabled remote"" and ""Bluetooth"" with some hiccups here and there but eventually the product is phenomenal in my 2 days experience.",Good TV for its price tag,B07XMD275S
"Picture quality is good even SD channels are viewable. HD contents from YouTube and Prime video are good to enjoy. Sound quality is not disappointing It would be great if I got voice remote with the TV, which is an added advantage in Motorola TV Overall good after one week usage For prime video registration issues update the system software and reset the device, now you can register in prime video.",One week usage rating,B07XMD275S
Excellent smart TV at a very affordable rate. The TV is better than I expected with full functionality. I am thinking of buying same with a bigger screen for another room though I do not require. One can compare it with the most popular brands. Just one issue - The Prime Video app does not register or accept my current id and password and asks to wait which never gets over. Tried many times in different ways. The Prime Video app works fine in other brand TV.,Amazing product,B07XMD275S
"Very Good Deal, picture and sound quality is good. Connectivity is seamless (WiFi, Bluetooth, Casting), package included a wall mount. Took a while to resolve the Amazon Prime app issue. The issue is that after login to Amazon Prime app, it will ask additional registration on primevideo/mytv site. Even after registering, the app doesn't proceed further. This issue was resolved after following the 2 steps: 1. System Update (Settings, About the Phone, System Update) 2. If the above doesn't solve, do a factory reset. (Settings, About the Phone, Reset)",Value Buy TV,B07XMD275S
I bought this television as it's features were awesome but when the tv arrived and i started using it i started noticing defects. 1. When we increase volume the audio started to distort when ever watching movie background music and sound started to mix and can't able to hear that sound. 2. Front pannel is not well placed in it. It's cause of the company cheap quality of plastic that they have used in television the front bezels are coming off due to which the light leaks this is with all vu televisions as i replaced it with another and found same defect in it . I have atached pictures of that . Think once before buying this television.,Worst company to in terms of quality,B07XMD275S
After sale service is very poor. I received product on 17th October 2019. Received mail regarding installation on 2nd Nov 2019. Now I received mail that my installation date is not confirmed. They also did not tell when they are going to install tv,After sale service is very poor.,B07XMD275S
"I am quite happy with my purchase of Vu 40GA. The picture quality of this tv is very good with wonderful rendition of HD content. The sound quality though depends a great deal on the source. Bluetooth connectivity, playback from USB drives, casting from smart phone all work well. Even composite input from an old DVD player via an old A/V cable gets reproduced without any hitch. The only thing lacking is mic support on the remote for Google Assistant. Had it been present, it would have been a perfect addition to the hotkeys for Netflix, Prime Video, YouTube and Google Play on the remote.",Excellent affordable smart Android TV,B07XMD275S
This product is well Demo has given proper way I am satisfied .,"Instalation is very well ,Demo has given properly",B07XMD275S
"I bought this tv this September for 9.2k. After 10days of use I'm reviewing this product. Pros : 1. Dedicated buttons for Amazon Prime, Netflix, YouTube,Hotstar. 2. Picture Quality is good. 3. Sound quality is awesome. 4. U will get wall mount with tv. 5. Connects with WiFi easily. 6. Build quality is good. 7. Android 9 pie version. Cons : 1. No Google assistance. 2. Every time u have to login to Amazon prime when u turn on Ur tv. Which is irritating. No remember me option. For this range I don't think u will get better TV. So my advice go for it.",Very good TV with awesome sound quality.,B07XMD275S
"Initially i was hesitant to buy VU brand. But this is for my parents , the were using old CRT TV.so wanted to upgrade it. Confusion between vu,MI,micromax,tcl and Santo. But many social media ppl replied with VU tv with half mind. Even i got offer for LV TV around 13k. But already i had LG TV, it was having diplay issue. Every 2 years, inside led plastics fell off. And spent 5000 every two years. So i don't want to go for LG brand. And ordered this vu android latest TV. Since it's new to the market, I didn't get many reviews. With half minded i ordered. Tv reached earlier than expected (remote village in Tamilnadu).. But installation didn't happen at scheduled time. 4 days later. So i saw my TV installed 2 days back only. Its not HD but HD Ready. But quality of video is perfect HD for 32 inches. Played Netflix and YouTube videos seamlessly... Many ppl reviewed other VU branda having low volume...no... Its sound volume is more than expected. For my family its enough. Dolby effect also gud . ( if u need more effect pls go for home theatre) Netflix, hotstar and YouTube with remote buttons, we can get easily. ( in hotstar i couldn't able to select subtitles) I reduced one star because, amazon prime button in remote. But its having login issues. Even though we registered out TV in amazon page, I can't run amazon prime in this TV. But its having Inbuilt Chromecast. So u can cast all from ur mobile to TV. Now i can't tell abt durability, but its worth for every penny... I think VU is cheap and best. Simply go for it ❤❤❤❤",Good and budget TV. Must buy if u need good issue logfing smart TV,B07XMD275S
"Absolutely brilliant! I was little skeptical about buying it since it was offering so much for so little. Its a 32 inch smart tv which offers great colours and contrast and surprisingly the white balance offered is good at this price. Sound quality is fine though not great. Smart TV features are working smoothly (youtube, Amazon prime, sonyliv ) i had no issues while launching applications or while streaming them infact i can compare it with my firestick which i have for my other room. It also has a blutooth receiver as well The build quality is more than acceptable. It doesn't feel clumsy at all, the provided Remote is also sturdy and its buttons are responsive. The only thing which is at the downside is the OSD menu which could have been better in terms of screen positioning and the user interface ... Anybody who wants to buy a smart tv should not think twice ..just go for it ! Its a steal at the current discounts and offers ..",Simply Awesome,B07XMD275S
"I am glad that i choosed this one over other brands and even bigger brands. Pros: Seamless internet connectivity Easy interface Awesome colors whether SD or HD Shortcuts app buttons on remote All app woking well. Amazon app had an issue, however updating android feom app and resetting the tv resolved this. Working with out any lag now. Played games in 32 inches version and compeltely a good experience. Pairing easy with blutooth devices. Jio cimema supported. Cons: Volumen is loud, but 100% clear. This does not mean it will impact voice, buy this without any hesitation. No blutooth remote which is necceessary now a days. Its not there i guess in any of the size i guess but not sure. ChromeCast does not work very well. Lag on the screen, i can say its not usable in this kind of lag Not much content available.",This Tv beats big brands!,B07XMD275S
"OK this is an update. The sound stopped working after 5 days but has since come back. Don't know why. Amazon not helpful on the matter in any case. The menu is slow but it's a good picture, and sound (when it works). Easy to set up. Just play and play. Very light in weight. Only gripe is when Sky box is on, the volume control on the sky isn't working. Only TV volume works. Voice recognition doesn't work at all.",It's OK.,B07XMD275S
"Amazon Prime video doesn’t work on the TV Registration is cumbersome, you need to go to the url mentioned.

"Except the Processor every thing is wonderful in this. Processor is very slow. Taking too much time to on or Booting very slow.

All apps functioning/working very fine. Must buy option in this segment.",Best Buy.,B07XMD275S
Just got the TV installed after a long wait(with VU dealer) . Picture quality is good. Sound quality is okay. Recommended to keep in standard mode if you don't have a external sound system. One last suggestion is DON'T DEPEND ON THE AMAZON SERVICE GUYS TO ASSIST FOR INSTALLATION.. THEY CHEAT YOU. After so much follow and Email exchange... We had to finally call the customer service of VU and get it INSTALLED FROM THE AUTHORIZED VU DEALER........ Happy with Product. Special Thanks to the VU service guy Mahesh Sharma for his assistance.,Good Product value for money..,B07XMD275S

"Review after first OTA update on October 9th 2019. I have been using the 32 inch android tv for a week now. The picture quality is amazing. Its an android tv so one has access to all important apps. Netflix, Prime video, hotstar, youtube among others. Users have been facing issue with accessing primevideo, but the latest Ota update solves the problem. Just update and do a factory reset. Viola it works! The sound is decent as well. You can pair bluetooth headset as well. The inbuilt speakers are also decent for a small room. Over all a quality tv for the price.

Pros Android Tv at affordable cost. Super from VU tv. Cons: No Remote Voice Assistant. Edit: VU customer service is awesome. They did everything to ensure my tv experience is good. They earned a loyal customer today. Amazon Prime works after recent OTA update.

Leaving this review after a week of use. Good tv ...connectivity is good ... buitin Chromecast is good ... No issues in connectivity. Sound is good. Differnet modes for different types of modes. Buit in apps work fine though Amazon Prime gets disconnected sometimes however i can always chromecast it from phone so no worries there. All in all a good TV and i am very happy with the performance so far,Amazing Smart TV at Amazing price,B07XMD275S
"I bought this after comparing it with many other branded TVs such as Samsung, Xiaomi, LG, Motorola, etc. But finally decided to buy this because it's an Indian brand and the features and quality it offers are comparable to those Big brands as Samsung and LG and can easily beat Chinese made TVs in terms of display and sound quality & clarity. I recommend this TV to all those who are in a tight budget but want a really good picture quality and sound in a TV that too from an Indian Brand. Also latest Android 9.0, Bluetooth 5.0 and Chromcast works very well. The interface is easy to operate. Also, you get five shortcut keys for each streaming media (Hotstar, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Youtube) in remote itself, so no hassle. I faced no connectivity issues so far. As far as voice control is concerned, one can use their smartphones to operate their tv via Google Assistance, you just need to download the Google assistance app and apply settings to it.",Best Offering from an Indian Brand.,B07XMD275S
Product is good but installation and costumes care is worst. Not see the performance of the TV yet so cant say about performance of the TV,Worst costomer care and installation of VU,B07XMD275S
"40"" Bought in 16010/- (with icici discount). Amazon allow to check product with ""free open box verification"" which is really helful. Nice picture clarity, good contrast ratio, there is li'l bit vibrating voice/music on high volume, 1080i videos plays smoothly. But wait.... there is lot of hectic for installation. My TV has been installed after 19 days from the product delivery. after 1 time service man refuse to came due to traffic and 2 times VECARE (amazon's vendor) appoint the service man which was not belongs to my area.

"I got the 40 inch Vu Smart android TV and it is just awesome at this price. I bought it in amazon sale. Initially all the apps(Netflix, Youtube, Hotstar, Zee5) were working fine expect prime video which was disappointing but the installation guy installed some update of 840 MB, reset the TV settings and then all apps were working smoothly. The clarity is amazing and is visible clearly from any angle. Though I was not impressed with the sound but that can be ignored as most of the TV's do not have awesome sound. I have compensated that with JBL soundbar and now its superb experience for me. For this price range this Vu TV fulfills all the criteria and if you want are planning to buy go for this.",Very nice for this price range.,B07XMD275S
"It's been 10 days and so far my experience with VU Ultra Android range has been phenomenal. The picture quality is really vibrant and vivid. The colours are perfect in this range. The display is far better than it's competitors and also the colours seem pretty natural. Coming to the sound section, the 20W surround sound Dolby system is absolutely mind blowing. The voice is clear and the music just mellows your ears. The bass and everything is pretty good and at this price point everything works phenomenal. Netflix works perfectly. Every other Android supported application runs the same. The Chromecast feature also works flawlessly. The only issue I have faced is with Amazon Prime video. The TV supports the app. But the app has not been registered with Vu TVs till now. So registering of the device doesn't work. So using amazon video works currently with Chromecast feature only. Apart from this everything is perfect.",Best Smart TV under 20k,B07XMD275S

"The product is as per our desire. It comes with all the advance features at affordable price. VU issues - None of the installation person turned up despite multiple dates offered and followup. Too bad service, complete dissatisfaction. Only Problem area : 1) Wifi link disables multiple times. Then we need to struggle going in setting 2) QWERT Keyboard remote to be shared. It takes long time to type 3) Sound quality is ok, since we have Sony 5.1 channel we enjoy the sound effects. Gives you a theatre feel",Quality product at affordable price,B07XMD275S
"Overall happy with the product. It is very less in price compare to other products with same features in market. Overall a good deal. Only thing that I feel missing is voice recognization in remote.

"Pictures quality is good,sound is just ok. System take updates after installation automatically when contented with wifi. Everything work fine but Problem is os system running very slow.

"The installer came and gave a quick demo but was not equipped to activate the voice recognition feature. Hence I have given a blank rating on that. The screen cast / mirroring experience is pathetic. The audio is immediately casted from my Android phone to the TV, but the pictures follow after a delay of over 20 secs. I have absolutely no delay when I use a Chromecast device cast fitted on a normal (non-Smart) Sanyo TV over the same wi-fi network. The users manual is also below expectation. It does not even mention the exact model of the TV set purchased. So I am left wondering whether they made a packing mistake or just don't care about perfection.","Promised a world class experience, but fell short",B07XMD275S
"Nice TV with Android 9 out of the box.Netflix,Hot star & YouTube are working fine, however struggling with Amazon prime... Able To cast however the inbuilt app doesn't work. Awesome Display with good brightness and clarity. Placed as second TV in bedroom and it has very nice stereo speakers with awesome sound and watching movies was fun with clear dialogues. First VU TV and its very impressive. As Usual amazon is the best when it comes to delivery and products. Box contains wall mount as well as stand. The Display panel is what impress me the most. The panel used is definately of high grade with awesome clarity. Let's see how VU perform in long run.",Great,B07XMD275S

One thing I am still worried about is that I am unable to screen share/connect my iPhone to Vu TV. It would be great if the manufacturer shares any docs to do the same. The rest all is great with them. Thanks!,Best deal for Android Indian TV,B07XMD275S

"When VU launched in India with LCD screen, i was impressed by there picture quality during that time. My First LCD was from VU which didn't gave issue for good 7 Years. After that it started giving LCD panel issue and went blank. Since Technologies changed LED gave better quality i thought to go for the VU LED TV. These was the second from VU, which i bought 2 years back. Today as i Write this second VU product gave the same issue, LED Panel display has gone blank. When the VU technician visit to check the issue, the option given is to replace the Display Panel. Which cost equivalent to new one. Also they have scripted answer, with Humidity /moisture this are common issues. I read some of the blogs this is one of the common issue reported by other user. With 2 experience by now the hefty cost for repair, i would recommend anyone to please give a second thought before buying VU products and life span of display. As on today VU have discontinued both the products which I had bought.",VU LCd/LED Panel has poor lifespan,B07XMD275S

"Amazing product from VU...This is my first Smart HD TV, and I realize what I have been missing all these years.... It's a beautiful looking TV, Picture Quality is life like (at recommend viewing distant), Sound is ample enough to fill a room with crisp and clear output (don't spend money buying a sound bar for this TV) and the apps are pretty Swift and easy to navigate (I mean not as swiftly as you can on your laptop or phones, but you'll get the hang of it). Only miss is the voice control remote, would have saved a lot of time typing the content name and don't even think of the Android TV remote its useless But Overall it's definitely an outright winner in the price range of 20k",It's the Mike Tyson of Smart HD TV in budget,B07XMD275S

"While everyone here is complaining about prime video thing, surprised that nobody mentioned the horrendous picture quality here. pixelation and washed out images are just too much of a pain and eye sore. made the mistake of buying a 43 inch, i would advise anyone else buying, go ahead and make the purchase, good product but get the 40 inch one instead, hopefully better picture quality on that. after my usage of a day, only streaming services, zee5, hotstar, google play movies, youtube, netflix, amazon prime, the picture quality for me is far away from a pleasing experience. images look quite a bit washed out and sometime over saturated, horrible contrast. get a DTH if you buying this, avoid using streaming service, picture quality is just awful. and yeah i do have a 200mbps connection, so no stream quality issue, but issue with the image quality on this tv.",Not that much interesting.,B07XMD275S
