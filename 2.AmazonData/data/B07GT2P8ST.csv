"Good Picture clarity Audio, similar to other TV sound. Mobile Screen casting works perfectly, just go to tv settings and select WiFi display. Install a third party screen cast app from playstore. Laptop screen sharing also works perfectly with Windows 10 built-in Wi-fi display options . You can cast Browser is present but with remote it's a nightmare. 3 hdmi. Presently using Xbox and no lag. WiFi speed is great, Netflix full hd plays perfectly. Good value for money",Good TV but not so smart,B07GT2P8ST

"We purchased the TV on 22 July 2019, The installation was done on the same day of delivery. The demo was also done and everything was fine. But there appeared a broken display at the top of the screen. I have attached a snapshot of the same. Didn't expect such an issue with TCL. Also the picture quality is much below expectations.

This TV is definitely worth the price. Internet connectivity is smooth and handy. I have been watching enjoying NETFLIX and Prime past 1 month and it goes without a glitch. If you are willing to go for a smart TV but don't wish to spend extravagant money then this TV should definitely be your first choice. Kindly don't consider all negative reviewers for this product as they are nothing but spammers.,Best Smart TV for the best price,B07GT2P8ST

We were told that someone from TCL company would come for the installation of the TV but now after 2 weeks also no one has turned up...He told us clearly that if we try to install then product warranty is cancelled. Now we have TV at our premises but no one has called for installation and we can not install...what to do? Is this a dead investment? who will help us?,TCL indifference,B07GT2P8ST
"Good TV with smart feachers. Sound quality should be improved, and the picture quality is average. I give 1 star because I installed the TV myself. I called TCL service center 7-8 time then an installation request could be registered. The installation was not done after 9 days of delivery so I desired to install it myself, because the next day the return period would be over.!",Average quality and the MOST poor services...,B07GT2P8ST

"Good build quality and vibrant colour screen. Delivered and wall mounted by Amazon guys in time as per schedule. The colors stand out very good for animation movies but dark backgrounds in horror movies show up poorly pixelated. For price of 18k its definitely value for money. Sound quality isn't that great, need to keep volume very high to understand dialogues. The tcl app store doesn't have much great apps, but Netflix and youtube are my only need so it's pretty much covered.",It has both Netflix for me and youtube for my kid,B07GT2P8ST

"I ordered TV Amazon and received it after 3 days only, quick service from Amazon. Higly recommended for TCL. Great Smart TV value for money. TCL brand is big brand like samsung and LG but issue with service centre is not good in north india. We struggle 5 days to get TV installation. However Amazon is very prompt and support for any issue. Service engineer has payment issue with TCL/Amazon that‚Äôs why they don‚Äôt act quickly. Service must be improve ASAP in Bihar and UP.

"The tv is really good and the quality is best in class for the price range. BUT THERE WERE TWO GUYS WHO CAME TO INSTALL THE TV SET ONE FROM THE AMAZON AND OTHER FROM THE TCL COMPANY ITSELF. EACH OF THEM CAME IN DIFFERENT DAYS. THE GUY WHO CAME FROM TCL WAS DRUNK AF, AND HE DEMANDED MONEY FOR THE INSTALLATION WHICH SHOULD BE FREE OF COURSE (WHICH WAS LATER GIVEN TO AVOID CONVERSATION WITH THAT DRUNKER) Hope the company takes care of this kind of stuff or else it will soon lose some genuine costumers like me who thinks to promote the quilaty product. One thing, that situation would be dangerous if there were no support for the women in my house. So please take care of this incident and hope you put an enquiry on him.",Very bad service,B07GT2P8ST

"Here's a perfect example of you get what you pay for. Smart only in name, this TV manages to do the bare minimum to call itself that. It comes with Netflix and YouTube. All the rest of the apps are useless to put it mildly. Youtube freezes the TV every 20 minutes requiring a restart. You will need an external speaker to actually hear anything worthwhile from the TV. Overall, I am disappointed. Primarily because my expectations were so low to begin with, it actually took work to make me feel worse about the spend. The TV managed.

"Writing this review after nearly 6 months of usage. Was it worth it as a TV? Yea. Totally! But as a smart TV? Not at all. Picture and sound quality are both appreciable, but the so claimed smart features are nothing but gimmicks. Be it screen share, network connectivity, audio played over android phone, everything with connectivity is very bad. But if people are ready to see past the shortcomings, it's a good TV. Hence, it is better to get a normal 40"" TV, than a smart one and suffer with this.",Great TV! VERY BAD SMART TV,B07GT2P8ST
"Please do not buy any tcl products, you will know its true colours if any problem arises. They will take almost 20 to 25 days to get it repaired that too after calling so many times. The terms between tcl and service centres are so pathetic that service centres may refuse to get it repaired because serive centres think they will not get money because actually they are not officially authorised service centres they are just 3rd party service centeres. They are asking me to bring the TV myself to service centeres which is not easy. Think before u buy.

The package was received on time - but the details shared on the website are not correct. I have been trying to call number shared for Installation for about 30 - 40 times (5 Hr.). When I got through I was told that the serial number is required whereas the website does say to share the serial number. It says only to share the order number. Assuming that this is the only the first interaction am not sure how and what kind of service would be provided Kodak ( 18001033036 & 180030002288),Instillation Problam,B07GT2P8ST
