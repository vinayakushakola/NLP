Cheap quality item which I received... Some sparking sound was coming out from speakers... So that I returned it,One Star,B07DTSCMMB
Terrible. Stopped working in 1 month and after sales service people making all excuses to not service the same.,Horrible,B07DTSCMMB
Pls don't purchase this TV. Very worst service,Pls don't purchase,B07DTSCMMB
"I bought this product from Amazon. First I struggled to had it installed. After installation it stopped working with a spark in back side of TV. I registered a complain with TCL call center and I was assured to attend it within 72 hours. After a wait of almost 10 days when I called them back, call center said ""as per my record your complain was resolved!!!"". When I told them that forget about resolution, your technician did not even call me. After being answer-less, call center guy disconnected the call and same thing happened with later calls. I am still waiting to have it repaired. I would suggest not to buy it. Bad quality product and extremely poor TCL services.",Stopped Working in 3 Months-Bad TCL Service,B07DTSCMMB
"Great TV. Great value for money. Good picture quality, sound quality is also above average, and if you want to know about durability, know that I am using it for a year now. Bought it on flash sale last year. I have used it with Tata Sky as well as with Amazon Fire TV stick. Absolutely no problems. Great value for money ❤️",Value for money.,B07DTSCMMB
Read a lot of negative comments. But honestly I had a very Good experience with this TV. It was delivered in less than 24 hour of my placing the order. To my surprise it was even installed in less than 24 hours of delivery. Picture quality and sound is very good. At this price this quality and sound is a deal. We can not compare a 12k product with a 50k product. But I am very happy for what I got in 12k.,Very Good quality at this price,B07DTSCMMB
Worst product.. Not working after 2 month.. Till now no response from Tcl. Think before buy. Service after sales totally horrible.,Worst product.,B07DTSCMMB
"Writing this review after being harassed by the worst service of this TCL TV. Purchased this TV in Oct-18 and it got fault in Dec-18 just in 2 months which creates a disappointment about the product quality. 22 days back I had registered a complaint number 33367501, till now 2 times technician visits, first technician tells any spare defective and the second technician tells any other spare defective but the matter fact is that no solution has been provided till date and 22 days crossed. Very Very disappointed and I will never suggest any of my contact channel to buy TCL products. In case the issue will not be resolved soon, I will highlight the matter in social media and will be filing a case in consumer court against the company.",WORST PRODUCT AND SERVICE I HAVE EVER SEEN,B07DTSCMMB

"I had purchased this TV and few months it ran smooth, after that suddenly the mother board had given problem. TCL customer care it's worst.

These guys had closed my ticket with out any information and I fighted them to open a escalated ticket. I was not sure how to proceed further..",No proper technical support and customer care,B07DTSCMMB
RETURNED BCS RECEIVED IN DAMAGED CONDITION,One Star,B07DTSCMMB
This is the worst product i have purchased. The moment the warranty period expired the TV stopped functioning. The company engineer charged 300 for home visit. He said panel needs to be replaced and coat of panel is same as the cost of the new TV.....this company is a fraud and all should boycott buying this company products,Worst customer service and quality of products,B07DTSCMMB

"The product is not upto mark, after 6 months display start giving issue in the form of line. Worst service center support for this product. After raising the TV issue one guy came to check. He said i will come next day after that no response for months. After 3 months they were called and ask they can'y do it now and need money for the repair. I will suggest this product if any one want to wast their money.","One of the worst service i found in industry,",B07DTSCMMB
"TV is working well but after 8 months display turns fade and black and white it better to go with Mi smart TV.

No Service centre ,No After Sales service",Do Buy this .Not for Long term.,B07DTSCMMB
Pros 32 inches large display. Low price. All accessories included in the package except wall mount. Wall mount brought by the installation Engineer. table top wall mountable. Sufficient sound for medium sized halls. Fully functional remote. Nice design. Cons Installation personnel lately installed. Customer care and after sales services are not upto the mark. No smart features. You must use stabilizer,Low priced high quality product. But Costomer care is poor. Compulsory use stabilizer.,B07DTSCMMB

"The TV with respect to its price can be categorised as a good one. The picture quality is decent. The sound quality is also up to the mark but could have been better. The build quality is also appropriate but use of better quality plastic could have made the feel of the TV even better. In all, the TV lives up to expectations and performs appropriately.","A good television, but could have been better.",B07DTSCMMB

If you compare with any reputed brand its average.,Its average Television,B07DTSCMMB
After 3 years usage running like its brand new. I took a chance when TCL started selling in India after long time. Paid off well so far. Very good sound and picture quality. Prices have come down now. Still a very reliable brand for those people who cannot afford Big boys.,Best bang for the buck,B07DTSCMMB

Decent picture quality, more than expected sound quality and output.",Require somebody to come for installation.,B07DTSCMMB
The TV has black lines after a year of usage. Lodged a complaint. TCL support seems to be clueless and team doesn't know steps to resolve.

"It's good tv, I suggest to buy it. if your bad luck knocks your tv and if you get any problem. the TCL India show you the worst experience you have ever seen. I have faced a problem black spot on the screen and raised a ticket on Sep 17th, 2017. Hyderabad TCL support team reached my home and take few snaps and said like there is panel problem and they are going to replace it. Ticket Number: 5269501 After few days I called to know my status support number 1800 419 0622 and they said we are looking into it. Again after few days on 5th Oct called to same support number and asked about the status of the ticket. Not even solving the problem they closed the ticket. Spoke with Support team lead and finally, after few days they reopened my ticket.then I realized that they need to order the panel from China. Every day I need to call the support and need to ask like "" Baba what is my ticket status"" 😶 After many follow ups I got an update like it's delivered to Hyderabad. Now the New Legend comes into my issue his Name is ""FEDEX"" . Oct 21 my packet is delivered to Hyderabad and today 7th Nov and still they are delivering that packet to TCL India( Hyderabad Branch) You guys need to follow up your docket number because it's not TCL part follow up the docket number where the packet is. If you want problems in happy and cool going life .. go and BUY the TCL TV",Very Bad Support Team,B07DTSCMMB

"I would highly recommend that no one should purchase this product. I received this tv on 1st march. It just worked for 15 days. Since then i have been calling tcl customer service, speaking to all the team leaders, and finally i got to the head of the technical department Mr. Balwant. Its been 4 months since then that ive been following up on this matter. He assured me that thr amount will be refunded, took my account details n kept telling me for 2 months that the amount has been transferred to my account. I knew there was something fishy. So i called up the call center again to check. They informed me that the refund was never sanctioned by the higher authorities. So on questioning Mr. Balwant, he puts me through some person called jeetender to claims to be the head of balwant, he promised me a call back after looking into the matter. On calling him several times he says the transfer of he amount has been cancelled bcos of gst. Isnt it funny? I called him up again he said he wasnt in office n again promised a call back which never happened. N evrytime i call him he disconnects my call. So people please think 1000 times before purchasing this product. Its been 4 monyhs n im still struggling to even talk to the right person in tcl. Right from the call center level to the managerial level....all r just fooling their customers.",Most pathetic product as well as service,B07DTSCMMB

But still i can't recommend this product for you!. Update: NO trouble as of 3 months of regular usage!. Glad that I have crossed 3 months. Will update after 6 months! Product Review: ~~~~~~~~~~~ If at all Amazon hadn't given this for such a low price of less than 9000/- I wouldn't have purchased it, reason being too many poor rating for it's after sale service. Though the add-on pack for free installation couldn't be added to Chennai location, still I had the option of choosing the free installation at the check out menu. Luckily TCL service is nearby my locality in Chennai, hoping I don't have to run around. Actual Cost : 12990/- Deal price : 10990/- Discounts: 10% with 1000 cashback as Amazon Pay Box contents: ~~~~~~~~~~ TV Unit x 1 Table Stand set x 1 Remote x 1 Warranty card & User manual x 1 Wall Mount: ~~~~~~~~ ♠ No call back, I had to request repeatedly for installation. ♠ Have to register with them through calling their customer care for warranty ♠ Call and confirm the installation. ♠ Basic wall mount would be provided free of cost with installation. --Took 2 days to complete the installation Some highlights ~~~~~~~~~~~~ ◘ Little over thin bezels, look great ◘ Ports: VGA, HDMI (2), USB (2), Component IN, Audio IN (DVD/PC), SPDIF, Antenna IN, Audio out (Amplifiers) ◘ 2 speakers in built in TV, decent if not great for voice ◘ Audio out port gives good clarity of sound when played musics (TV pre-amp is good) ◘ Graphic spectrum for music player is just for showpiece and don't expect any ◘ Plays MKV, MP3, avi, MP4, but 1080p is little overload for this TV ◘ Picture quality is decent (for a 720p) for a 10K price and no complaints ◘ For warranty claim (Note, slip is not sealed or attested) Amazon invoice bill is mandatory and you need to call them ◘ PC using 720p (1280) resolution at 32inch may not be pleasing ! Picture quality is decent for its asking price and I have no complaints. Color reproduction is precise and sharp for a 720p panel. Plus, you wouldn't expect more from a 720p as the telecast from set top boxes doesn't exceed beyond 720p resolution, it is a proper balance. Final words: ~~~~~~~~ I may not recommend this product though it has served well for me, as a matter of fact after sales service is very important and this TV seriously lacks. It is only the pricing and cashback that lures the customers and I did fall for that. At slightly less than 9000, this TV is not a big hole in my pocket if it repairs and all I expect is 1 to 2 years time to work. If you still would like to, then make sure you have access to TCL Service in your town nearby and if you get special offers below 9K which can help you come out of vex later. Hope it helps If this review is of any helpful, consider making it more helpful for others.","At 9K, this is not making a hole in my wallet but without a proper service this is not for you !",B07DTSCMMB

Sound is not so good while playing movies through USB but it's enough for daily viewing, however you may desire louder sound for some movies or while playing your favorite song. Sometimes even at full volume you would want more to enjoy the sound effects. However, if you can install external speakers this is the best TV at this cost..",So far so good..,B07DTSCMMB

"After doing a few research on the best Televisions of 32 inch and under 15 thousands, finally I have purchased this TV. Yesterday, the TV has been delivered at home and the initial impressions are good. I got Rs. 1000 discount and don't wait so long for the discount until there is a great Indian festival season. This has got maximum Rs. 1000 discount so far. In some season there might be some chances to get discounts on the Bank cards, if you have those card you would get maximum Rs. 2000 discount. Now, will tell you about the TV Unit. The weight and size is well managed. Sound output is enough and not great and low. It fulfils your basic to mid-range requirements. I cannot say that this is a great TV, becuase I have not tested of used other TVs in the category. Though, saying that this is a best TV, will not be fair. If, you are in hurry to buy a TV and ask me for my opinion, I will say buy it. Anyway, I will post some more details about the in-depth tech-specs or the performance later. There are some reviews on the YouTube, and those are useful. Thanks,",A good LED TV,B07DTSCMMB

"Bought it on 28th June & delivered by 2nd july in Jaipur. Best budget Tv in this range as compared to other brands..I searched many brands in this range ( below 15k) and finally ordered TCL from Amazon after seeing so many positive reviews by customers. Prons- Best brand in this price range Build quality is very good Sound Quality is also good Video Quality is superb Looking like a top brand Cons- Only one thing bothered me is demo & installation by TCL. I called the tcl customer care first day when I got it on 2nd july17, but after so many nobody came for installation. Finally on 15th July I saprately purchased wall mount from local market and fixed it on wall by a local machenic. Which cost me around 500 rupees.",Best budget Tv below 15K,B07DTSCMMB
The product is good. Its certainly worth its money. The service from tcl is pathetic. Its almost 10 days since i bought it and even now the installatio is not done. The customer care will tell that it will be done today only but it never happened.

Got this at an amount of 9900(Including cashback) The only one drwback is, it lacks 3.5mm audio jack out, so we can not use a headset directly, but its not an issue, bcaause nobody wants to use headset with tv, for using home theatre we can use R+L cables for connecting which will come with most of the home theatres.

"I use this with an Android 7.1 TV Box and a Windows 10 mini PC through the two HDMI ports. I do not use this with a cable TV connection. Display is excellent . Both the Windows 10 mini PC and the Android 7.1 TV box recognise this as a 1080p native resolution display. But, this TV is marketed as a 720p device....Why ? IDK. The different shades of white , off-white, grey, dark grey , black etc etc can be distinguished well. You can observe this when using the color calibration images. The TV also has Standard, Dynamic, Mild and User modes. The backlight , contrast, etc settings are automatic for all modes except User mode. Youtube , Netflix , Prime Video ( both Android and Windows versions ) look excellent in 1080p resolution on this TV . Display is good when browsing the Net too. I availed of the exchange offer , and this 1080p 32 "" TV cost me INR 11K. Since I have paired this TV with an Android 7.1 TV Box ( costing INR 3.6K ) , I now have 1080p 32"" Smart Android 7.1 TV for a total cost of rupees 14.5 K. The HDMI ports are placed very conveniently to the side . Make sure to use type A HDMI cables with SLIM heads . HDMI cables with fat plugs ( heads ) cannot be plugged in . I have not used the VGA or USB ports or cable TV connection ports. Windows users FYI: Ensure that under Graphic properties , the Resolution is set to 1080p and ,most importantly , the frequency is set to 60p Hz. Use the TV remote and set picture mode as "" Panorama"". The picture will fit perfectly . I have not used this for high end gaming or as a normal cable TV .","Excellent display unit with 1080p, good color reproduction , and with different picture modes",B07DTSCMMB

"One of the coolest LED's for this price, serves the purpose, and has free installation. The brand is a sub brand of India (In India). So quality is good. It's light weight and power efficient too. The only downside is its screen being a bit soft, if you put your finger on it, you can see the prints left there for few seconds even after your removal, but who puts there finger on the TV screen?",Best buy for the price!,B07DTSCMMB
"The set is working fine, I feel its a good purchase at this price. The installation team came the second day after I called them. The equipment to hang it on wall is also with them so you need to contact them for it. they were quite responsive and gave a good demo and told me to contact them in case of any problem operating the set. Only one thing not good it that the remote is a bit less powerful than other brands like samsung etc. as you have to keep it in straight alignment with the set to operate.","The set is working fine, I feel its a good purchase at this ...",B07DTSCMMB

"Excellent product compared to the price,I don't find any difference between Samsung or LG with this product, Most of my relatives are using the very similar specifications product @18000 Plus-Rupees, Why? But I bought a very good LED television & saved reasonable amount of money also. I must appreciate the picture clarity & sound clarity of the product, Simply awesome for the money I paid. The only concern is product & service quality, I hope nothing will happen at least for another 2-3 years period. Thanks to Amazon & TCL.",Excellent Product For The Money,B07DTSCMMB
Television is working just fine... I found that a authorised service center is present in my city so I am happy about future repairs....,Working Nicely,B07DTSCMMB
"i would highly recommend that one should purchase this product. I received this tv on 1st march. It just for 15 days. Since then i have been calling tcl customer service, speaking to all the team leaders, and finally i got to the head of the technical department Mr. Balwant. Its been 4 months since then that ive been following up on this matter. He assured me that thr amount will be refunded, took my account details n kept telling me for 2 months that the amount has been transferred to my account. I knew there was something fishy. So i called up the call center again to check. They informed me that the refund was never sanctioned by the higher authorities. So on questioning Mr. Balwant, he puts me through some person called jeetender to claims to be the head of balwant, he promised me a call back after looking into the matter. On calling him several times he says the transfer of he amount has been cancelled bcos of gst. Isnt it funny? I called him up again he said he wasnt in office n again promised a call back which never happened. N evrytime i call him he disconnects my call. So people please think 1000 times before purchasing this product. Its been 4 monyhs n im still struggling to even talk to the right person in tcl. Right from the call center level to the managerial level....all r just fooling their customers this. must not happen tcl big looser",cheated me,B07DTSCMMB

For Amazon services: I am disappointed that you went for such worse transportation. For TCL services: That's why peoples not buying your product. LOL, you are going down soon. For Gati services: Go .... yourself. You wasted my time. Warning: Don't buy this product, don't go for TCL, don't go for Gati transport.

"I bought is as second tv at my home for purposes so that kids can watch for around 30 min in a day. And it is perfect fit for such job. You should not buy this as your first tv at your home as experience with tv is that you get what you pay for. I bought it around 6 months back and picture quality wise it is very normal. One can easily spot differences in picture quality of this tv and brands like samsung. Now coming to problems thatbi am facing with this tv: First of all it doesn't have any switches on tv to turn on, off, adjust volume etc. as result of which you always rely on remote. One can argue that on tv switches are seldom required but once you don't have them you realize it's importance. Anyhow second and stupid issue I have faced is that tv isn't turning on now. To my surprise when I called up service centre in working hours I have been told that service centres are closed for next 5 days on account of Holi..ahh...I can't believe this. Service centre being closed due to a festival for 5 days...that's why I said you get what you pay for. I am pretty sure this wouldn't be case with Samsung, Sony or any d3cwnt branded tv. So choice is up to you to make...",Expect what you pay for....,B07DTSCMMB

"PROS: It's been around 50 days since I bought this TV and it is working absolutely fine. Quality product in the cheapest price, it cost me only Rs. 9,990 (11,490 - 1,500 (HDFC CC cash back)). Great picture quality for HD channels and HD videos, SD channels are also look fine if we connect with HDMI port. Sound is good, no need to buy additional 2.1 or 5.1 speakers. Quality of plastic material used to build this TV is strong and tough. Fast CC service in Delhi, I got my wall mount installed in only 24 hrs. Supports most of the video formats. CONS: Small dark shades are appearing on all four corners of the TV, I called up CC for this, they told me that ""it appears default in their all TVs and no need to worry about it"". However they sent their guy to my home to reconfirm if there is any other problem. I got only 18 months of manufacturer warranty and no options available to extend this, even if we pay for it. (Planning to buy 2 years of third party warranty from Amazon, it will cost Rs. 1,500). Bass effect is not available in sound, it's in-built speakers generates unpleasant sound if we increases the volume to full. TCL field executives don't have enough knowledge of their products. TCL does not even has their customer support in India they depend on third party vendors for this.

Good option if your tight on budget or want a second TV. Technician came (standard fixed wall mount is free) and fitted but charged double the amount for customised wall mount.

"** Initial Impressions ** ● The box had the TV, desktop stands & screws, warranty card and user manual ● The bezel is very thin and is glossy black which gives a premium look to the TV from the front. The power cord is built into the TV that cannot be unplugged ● There is a low profile TCL logo at the bottom center of the bezel. There are navigation buttons hidden below the logo incase the remote control does not work. The remote is quite handy and has a glossy black finish ● There is a Connectivity Bay that faces back that houses these ports - VGA female port to connect computers - Component Video In phono plugs to connect DVD video - Left & Right Audio In phono plugs to connect DVD audio or computer audio - SPDIF ● The bay that can be accessed from left houes these ports - Two USB ports - Two HDMI ports to connect HD set top box or Blu Ray player - Coaxial Antenna In to connect Cable TV or TV areal antenna - Audio Out left & right phono plugs to connect to external speakers ** Installation & Warranty ** ● I got a call from TCL requesting TV installation on the day of delivery, but was before delivery. I could not reach them on phone once the TV was delivered to me. After two days, I called TCL customercare and raised a request. After waiting for three days, I self-installed the TV and then I was contacted by the technician! ● Amazon told me its okay to self-install the TV, but need to get in touch with the local TCL service center to get the warranty registered. But, my local Service Center told me its not required and the Amazon bill is enough to claim warranty. Quite confusing and misinformed! But finally, I was told to send the bill and serial no over Whatsapp to the technician ● Installation involved only the fixing of desktop stand which can be done if you have a star-screwdriver. But if you plan to wall-mount the TV, TCL technician will bring in the free wall-stand ** Usage & Performance ** ● The TV turns on with a TCL animation which I did not like really. I disabled this from the Options menu ● Clicking Menu button on remote opens a tile with options like TV, Multimedia, Source, Options, etc. The different sources are TV, AV, VGA, HDMI1, HDMI2 and Component Video - TV is for analog channels that goes through the inbuilt TV tuner. If you have a rooftop areal connected, you can watch Doordarsan - When VGA is selected, the TV will pick up video from VGA port and audio from Audio In phono plugs - You can connect set top box to HDMI port ● The multimedia tile will take you to features to play video, music, photos, etc. I tested videos in mkv, avi, wmv and mp4 and all worked well. I played music files in mp3 formats only ● The subtitles in English are displyed for USB movies, but not any other Indian languages ● When turned on from Standby, the TV opens into the last input source you were in. If there is no signal from the selected source, the TV switches through all sources and stops at the first available signal ** Display & Sound ** ● The display has got good brightness, richness & clarity and I dont have anything to complian about it. But if you sit too close in the order of 3 or 4 feets, 720p screen is sure to show up the pixels. But beyond that distance, you can't spot a difference between this display and a full HD display of the same size ● I played a 1080p mkv movie from USB and every 20 or 25 seconds, there was a quick freezing of screen which was not there for videos in other formats ● I have connected Sundirect HD DTH and it is a pleasure to watch the channels. Standard Definition videos in 4:3 format gets stretched to fill the screen in 16:9 ratio ● I am very much impressed with the sound reproduction. I watched Avatar from USB and the preset Movie mode produced good bass effects which I really liked. There are two down-firing speakers which works really well ** I don't like these ** ● While music is played, there is a nice graph visualisation displayed on the screen, but that is just a dummy and is very ugly as well ● There should have been an option to turn the TV screen off while music is being played from USB ● The remote has got a Return button that is supposed to take us back to the previous menu item, which does not work infact ● The click quality of the remote is also not upto the mark, but the click feeling is really good. For some functions to work, I have click more than once ● There is a white light below the TCL logo that turns on when the TV is on Standby. I dont like this which is very bright and looks very ugly for me at night ● There is no way to browse through all the contents in a connected USB. If music is selected, only music files are displayed and the same for videos and photos. I prefer seeing all the contents of a connected device ** Summary ** ● I had earlier purchased a 55 inch 4K TCL and is satisfied with that; it gave me the confidence to go for this one ● I am quite happy with the input options, video & audio quality and USB playback. I paid Rs.13,490 in May-17 and I rate FOUR stars. One star off on all those things that I dont like.",Good TV with all what I need for the price,B07DTSCMMB

"Hello People. I'm writing this review with very sad mood. Totally disappointed with this tv. Disappointed because of.. Video picture quality is below average, sound is pathetic, as it goes totally down n up automatically. While playing FHD videos, this tv lags every 3rd or 4th second. TCL service is too bad. Called more than 6 times than they came for installation, at the time of installation I was not present as I was at work, the installation guy fooled my mom by selling a dth 3 pin for ₹400 as he said that your previous dth 3 pin will not work on this tv, you have to own this, so my mon paid him ₹400 for a 3 pin audio video cable. Amazon charged me ₹50 for delivery and delivered me before the given date. Sound and video of USB files are too bad. So guys, think 10 times before you purchase this television. Better to go with SANYO 32"" LED tv. You can get at 12999 in offer and at 13499 without offer. My friend have the SANYO tv and the clearity and sound is very good. I purchased my this TCL tv for 13499 with no cost EMI. But I can only cry, no other option. I repeat, please don't buy..","Please don't buy, Learn from my mistake, don't repeat the mistake.",B07DTSCMMB

"I got this model through reliance digital for less than 13k. Service was excellent by them it was not by TCL guys. Nxt day delivered and installed on same day. In this page it has mentioned 18months warranty but actually when I got it from store it is 3yrs warranty and everything done by reliance digital which is certainly very good. There might be some difference in serial numbers (I’m not sure). Now comes to picture quality, never compare with Sony, Samsung and Panasonic those are different level brands. Try comparing with Mi tv, VU. In this comparison, I can say TCL is better than Mi. Though Mi has smart and 1000rs higher picture quality is not up to TCL. Even sound output is far better than 2 other competitors. End of the day its your comfortablity to choose better one. My friends suggested me Mi Tv but I have gone with TCL because I found it more convincing than other 2. It has wall mounts too in the box but in amazon reviews they mentioned no wall mounts. So please ensure everything and buy this product. Thank you",Worth for less than 13k range TVs,B07DTSCMMB

"Ordered my TV on 11.08.2016 and was delivered on 17.08.2016. Fixing the stand was a bit tricky but not that difficult. Picture clarity is awesome. Sound is awesome once you do the wall installation. Easy to connect your USB flash drive or Hard disk. Picture are not being displayed. Only videos are playing. Does not have an AUX port but has sound output slot. So if you want to connect external speakers then you have to use an RCA male to AUX converter. Registered for wall mount installation on 17.08.2016 late night and was done on 21.08.2016. 18.08.2016 being holiday, the promised timelines of 72 WORKING HOURS was adhered to. On the whole, TV is worth the money spent. This is definitely a better option than other TV brands like Micromax, Sanyo, and others in this price range keeping in view the proven brand record of TCL in countries like US.

Now I bought this 32 inch TCL TV, this is also superb. It has 2 HDMI, 2 UBD ports to connect devices. Great choice, I bought this TV for the price of Rs 10,000 in a good deal. I recommend TCL TV's.

"I would highly recommend that no one should purchase this product. I received this tv on 1st march. It just worked for 15 days. Since then i have been calling tcl customer service, speaking to all the team leaders, and finally i got to the head of the technical department Mr. Balwant. Its been 4 months since then that ive been following up on this matter. He assured me that thr amount will be refunded, took my account details n kept telling me for 2 months that the amount has been transferred to my account. I knew there was something fishy. So i called up the call center again to check. They informed me that the refund was never sanctioned by the higher authorities. So on questioning Mr. Balwant, he puts me through some person called jeetender to claims to be the head of balwant, he promised me a call back after looking into the matter. On calling him several times he says the transfer of he amount has been cancelled bcos of gst. Isnt it funny? I called him up again he said he wasnt in office n again promised a call back which never happened. N evrytime i call him he disconnects my call. So people please think 1000 times before purchasing this product. Its been 4 monyhs n im still struggling to even talk to the right person in tcl. Right from the call center level to the managerial level....all r just fooling their customers.",I would highly recommend that no one should purchase this product,B07DTSCMMB

After few days the guy turns up ask all the details of the product & shipment. (Got an impression that he wanted to inform his higher authority about he has done the installation). 4) Thought American, but Chinese :( . product.

"Everything about the product is very good and worth given the competitive pricing. In my opinion only two things are lacking in this product but i think you get what you pay. 1) Viewing angle is no that great, the screen has a lot of gamma and color fades when viewing from sideways. But when we are at center or not that far sideways from center there is no issue. Again given what i am paying for, i think this is the best TV in the price section and nothing too critical to complain about. 2) Instead of placing the video output along with the YPbPr ports they could have provided an extra video out port separately. The things i liked about this monitor 1) 32 inch 720p : ideal for the SD DTH and HD ready DTH services. For best picture quality get HD DTH service 2) 2 USB ports, plays most of the video formats MKV, MP4 etc 3) 2 HDMI ports 4) Slim design and narrow border panel",Everything about the product is very good and worth given the competitive pricing,B07DTSCMMB

"(Update )It's been 4.5 months since I purchased this TV. Its running smoothly and there are no problems. Even the SD channels are very clear at an acceptable viewing distance. I recommend to couple it with airtel DTH (since it gives best picture quality). The sound output is amazing. The bass is clear unlike other led/lcd TVs which sound like they are kept in a box. This is a really good product. Good value for money. Both video and sound outputs (Dolby digital) are excellent unlike other low priced led TV's. Perfect for medium sized hall. The only problem is with the customer care. If they miss to send technicians on the decided day, they will take another 2-3 days to come and install the TV. I would really recommend this TV .",Amazing TV at a budget price.,B07DTSCMMB

For a 32 inch TV to be at around the 12k price range does usually mean there might be some major trade off. Fortunately the TCL L32D2900 is fairly stable a product a works pretty well. The HD quality might not be as great as a Sony or an LG. The excess sharpness at times is a bit jarring but can mostly only be noticed while console gaming or watching a really bright hi-res video.,Brilliant for the price,B07DTSCMMB

The waiting time at TCL is very long and on 12.07.2017, my CALL WAS KEPT ON HOLD FOR 15 MINUTES (yes, 15 minutes) UNTIL I DISCONNECTED. So, buy it only if you want the TV without wall-mounting.

"i bought this TCL tv after big research , i enquired customer care about installation, service, wll mount ,warranty. after keen observation only i have chosen this one. now i give you my prepurchase and postpurchase experience to you. PREPURCHASE: 1.I thought of buying 40 inch, then i have chosen because my hall size is small.(if your hall size is small ,never go for 40 inch) 2.warranty is 1.5 year , that is a good one. 3.for our local cable, or dth you never need 32 inch full hd tv.. 32 inch hd ready is more than sufficient. 4.customer care is so responsive, but they don't know the exact technical specifications of tv, other than provided by company. 5. i bit worried about LED technology, whether it is DIRECT LIT LED (DLED) OR ELED(EDGE LIT LED). till today my doubt is not yet clarified. POSTPURCHASE: 1. LOOK wise very nice, 2. plays all most all video formats. 3. remote is easily accessible for old age people. 4.u can also connect mobile as usb storage . 5.picture clarity is very fine, i hope it is DLED. 6.VERY LOW WEIGHT. 7.play malayalam premam 720p movie , u can easily understand the clarity of tv. 8.installation done with in 2 working days.free wall mount and installation. 9.

I will give 4 star for TV assuming it's durability is good. Now come to service part. TCL customer care listen to your problem but I think they are helpless as they have given service to third party called RELIANCE. I have ordered TV on 10 Aug. And was delivered on 14 the of August. Till date I am in contact with TCL customer care. Requested thrice for wall mount and finally RELIANCE engineer arrived on 23rd Aug. He said TCL not provide wall mount for your TV. You have to purchase it. I told him that TCL assured me that installation is free. He charged me rs700 for stand and installation. (P.s.As TCL and RELIANCE came to know about the matter, they have taken quick and strong action, within few hours service engineer refunded the amount taken for stand and installation as he was unaware of the installation term. Mr. Jignesh from TCL assured me about no further inconvenience from there side. Mr. Sahil from reliance also assured for further co-operation in any problem in service part. Thanks to both of them to resolve the matter.) I am happy with the product and the service. Now I m giving 5 star to TCL. All the best.",Product and service both are good.,B07DTSCMMB

"Here Are Some Pro's And Con's Must Read Before Spending 15,000... Pro's: -1. First is undoubtedly the size of the display at which you getting for the given price tag. It is a 32 inch TV, in centimeters that would be 81.28. 2. Talking more about the display it comes with a resolution of 1366×768 pixels. Technically it is a HD ready panel. Right now it is impossible to get more than an HD ready screen. Because that will dramatically increase the price or you will have to compromise the screen size. The refresh rate is of 60 Hertz which is same for all budget TV. 3. The viewing angles is also quite decent with 178 degrees. That’s 8 degrees more than most other TV. The colors, brightness and saturation does have no any changes if you are watching within that viewing angles. Viewing Angles in Degrees4. Another advantages is that it comes with 2 HDMI port for connectivity. Normally all budget panels come with a single HDMI port. Connectivity and Ports5. The same goes with the USB port, it comes with two of them. It is actually hard to find one with 2 USB ports. Con's :- 1. The primary problems or issues is with the power consumption. It requires 45 watt while the panel is on display. 2. Next cons or disadvantages is that only two ready-made modes are available viz. cinema mode and sports mode. 3. If you are thinking to mount on the wall without leaving any space on the backside, well then its not possible. The reason is the because it requires a lot of space due to the 18 cm thickness. It just gonna look like the TV is hovering in space.",Best Tv Under 15K...Budget Led Tv?..,B07DTSCMMB

"I loved the TV what a pleasant surprise. I always knew TCL was good but never expected this quality for this price. Nice bright display, spotless pic quality and decent quality plastics used. BUT EXACTLY AFTER 1 YEAR MY TV SCREEN BLANKED OUT 😜",Pleasant Surprise BUT,B07DTSCMMB
Really a good product. It’s been a month now. Free Installation was arranged as per my appointment and free wall mount was provided by the Amazon Service person. Very friendly approach by the team and responsive. Overall a good buying experience. Product is good so far and hope it would be good in TCL Service also. The lifetime is not assured for the display and the after sales service is not up to the mark as many other brands. Perhaps you can expect anywhere a life of 3-18 months. Apparently it’s your turn of luck. Much disappointed people!,Good Buying Experience and but BAD LIFE,B07DTSCMMB
