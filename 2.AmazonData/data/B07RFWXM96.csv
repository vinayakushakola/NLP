"Hello buyers, Just want to alert you that the bluetooth feature in this TV will only connect bluetooth mouse and bluetooth keyboard. It will not connect to any bluetooth speaker , bluetooth home theater or any other blutooth device. On Amazon, they have just written supports bluetooth as yes, which is definitely misleading, and I am the victim of it. I paid 10000 extra only for getting bluetooth so that I can connect my bluetooth speaker with it but when I installed this TV and tried to configure my speaker it was not even getting searched. Then I called SONY company and they told me that we can only connect bluetooth mouse and bluetooth keyboard in thie version of TV. Please be aware before buying it. Either buy an earlier version (which does not have bluetooth but other features are exactly the same) or if you want a real and proper bluetooth TV , go for higher versions. Thanks",Bluetooth connects only mouse and keyboard,B07RFWXM96
"This 2019 sony X8000G is same as like 2017 sony lineup tv X8200E.. Same price Range 84k after 2 years, Sony didn't reduced the price... In spec they Reduced speakers from 40w in 2017 to 20w in 2019... Nothing other changed, Same spec (Triluminos display, 4k hdr, android tv) ... 2017- Sony 43"" X8200E - ‚Çπ82000 box price, then 76k 2019-Sony 43"" X8000g - ‚Çπ84000 box proce, then 66k, but 2 yr old spec nearly same price Sony really need to Upgrade their TV‚Äôs... Sony TV‚Äôs Are like Apple iphones in india... More Tax...(in other countries sony big screen tv cost low compare to india) eg: In dubai(uae) sony 55-inch x8500f cost 50k-56k in indian price but here more than 85k..).. Guys i been searching for good tv for past 2 years, I'm not satisfied yet.. I will update here once i get new tv... Here are the list yu can remember before yu buy.. If you are sony fan try to find it year from its model Eg: X8200E - E for 2017 model X8500F - F for 2018 models X8000G - G for 2019 models 1. Picture quality and Sound (4k hdr, hdr10+, dolby vision, dolby speaker) HDR- like android , Dolby - like apple IOS.. these are future.. 2. UI ( As for now 1. Lg-(Web Os) is fast, 2. Samsung (Tizen) - good, 3. Sony,Tcl- (Android)- Laggy..) only oled sony tv UI are fast, for other sony Android TV's its slow.. 3. Don't buy without seeing it in real, go and visit store and experience it, (They usually demo 4k content, ask them to play SD, HD content... So that yu can see how tv upsales the picture quality... In india mostly we have SD, HD content.. I can suggest you some tv models.. 1. Samsung The Frame 55"" Tv, is now on offer for 80k on Flipkart, it has qled tv not normal led... It is online exclusive on Flipkart and Samsung store... You will get all the high end features in this tv... It is great for gaming too, has 120hz refresh rate... It has one connect box where yu can connect all cables(usb, dish, power) only one cable that connect tv to one connect box..this one connect box available only for top end tv's in samsung like Q90, Q80, Q80.. This is the only tv that has this option under 85k.. Tv is just flat, it has zero gap wall mount too..it means no gap between wall and tv... Booting time is really fast not like android... It has art mode (like frame on your wall) and motion sensor, it will turn off automatically when no motion is detected, and on automatically when person is before tv.. I been searching for good tv for the past 2 years, at last i decided to buy this samsung frame Qled tv... Some other tv in my suggestions.. 1. LG C8 oled for 1lk.. If you are from Tamil Nadu and if you like oled tv for 1 lk... Visit (sathya stores) in the city.. You can get LG C8 oled for 1lk.. You can visit their website too.. Its 2018 lg flagship tv... Yu can visit the store and buy.. 2. In Tcl C series tv.. Like C6(120hz refresh rate and front firing speaker) , C2(last yr model) ... 3. Vu premium android 4k tv, buy this series on Flipkart... If you want budget... If yu feel picture motion is laggy, try to see it on movie mode.. Better visit vu store and check.. 4. Sony bravia X95G, cost is high above 1lk.. X85G=X85F(same spec only difference X85G has dolby atmos and dolby sound currently available in 55""...cost under 1lk... Before buying it online.. Go and visit stores like brand or other than brand store... They may have less cost compare to online...",Its same as like 2017 sony X8200e.. Same price even after 2 yrs old model...,B07RFWXM96
Hands down the best purchase from Amazon. An amazing TV with an impeccable display. Superb contract and color vibrancy. The TV sound quality complements the experience aswell. Icing on the cake has to be the android TV ease .,Go for it !,B07RFWXM96

"1. Sony TV is anyday good, thought of buying Oneplus QLED but 1+ seems to be having lot of issues. 2. Better to go for bigger screen. 3. Getting extremely good Dolby digital when connected to 5.1 home theatre especially on AmazonPrime and YouTube. 4. 1/2* for Amazon they didn't give me Oakter smart home kit worth 8.5k, it is better to buy from retail outlet near your house they are better and they have similar offers.",Good TV,B07RFWXM96

"The Sony X800F is the best 65 inch 4k TV in the mid-range category. It's a great 4k TV that delivers great overall picture quality with deep blacks, excellent peak brightness, and a wide color gamut for HDR content. It also has great smart features, with one of the widest selections of apps, and the interface has recently been updated to the even easier to use Android Oreo. This TV has outstanding motion handling, thanks to its remarkable response time, similar to the P Series Quantum, so there is almost no noticeable blur trail behind fast-moving objects. Unfortunately, the best image quality is reserved for this sitting directly in front, as the image degrades when viewed at an angle. The full array local dimming feature is decent but may be distracting at times. Overall, this is a great 4k TV and the best 65 inch TV for the money as tested.","Overall, this is a great 4k TV and the best 65 inch TV for the money as tested.",B07RFWXM96
Very good TV,Very good TV,B07RFWXM96
I have not purchsed this tv from amazon but I will still give a review so that it can be helpful to other buyers. The picture quality is beyond doubt the best amongst all other tv's available in 43 inch segment. The motion flow technology for videos is just awwwwww awesome. U can upscale any stamdard video easily and its motion flow would surprise you in the best possible way. Other android features are in line with user requirement and any tech guy would love it. Only one surprise is that the screen has 50 hertz refresh rate but it is taken care of by upscaling motion flow enhacement. Overall this is a very good product but the price is a little bit on the higher side.,The best there is in this segment (43 inch),B07RFWXM96
Can connect Bluetooth with headphones and speakers as well Picture quality better than the previous Sony android tv series 3.0 USB port 1Amp output USB port for charging InBuilt Screen Mirroring WifiDirect 4K HDR Bass Reflex In Built Speakers In Short Your all needs from a Android Tv ends up here,Best Series #X80-G,B07RFWXM96
How can anyone buy this costly TV unless he has lots and lots of black money. Government needs to bring more strict anti corruption laws .,Beautiful.,B07RFWXM96
I decided to gift my parents a 43 inch 4k tv for their anniversary. After a lot of research on shops & online portals I decided to buy this TV. In beginning I was a little skeptical looking at the cost as my budget was 50k but bought it on prime day at a discounted rate of 62k as I had experienced the product at a nearby store. Go it delivered to my hometown & called up Sony guys & they were quick in installation. In my opinion display quality & design of the product is just out of the world. Cool features like Android & voice assistant are an added advantage. My parents loved the gift & are very happy with it. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who‚Äôs looking for a premium 4K TV. Don‚Äôt compromise on quality because of a little price difference. You can go for no cost EMI just like I did. Hope this helps.,Super product. Worth every penny!,B07RFWXM96
