Good Products. Pictures quality are awesome. Sound is good Dolby audio. and connectivity better than mi tv. We have not found any problem using after 1 month+,Tv is Awesome for pictures quality. Value for money,B07GTD1LHY
3 week ago I brought this tv and with in one week tv giving the problem of volume so I replace and brought again same but 2nd time also it's showing same problem.,Volume issue,B07GTD1LHY
Nice response ... But ... Who set the TV.. (contact number),Good,B07GTD1LHY
I have received product on time 18 June 2019.... After that installation person not at all contacting ... TCL service number also not working .... Highly dissatisfied with the service of Amazon and TCL ...I need to return this product no other options....,Don't buy - No installation unnecessary money waste,B07GTD1LHY
A perfect full hd tv with great viewing angle worth the price with complete android experience with all app available,Worth every single penny (FULL PAISA WASOOL),B07GTD1LHY
I received a different or damage product...,Damage product,B07GTD1LHY
"It's simply the best smart TV based on Android. Its very easy to use, remote is ergonomically designed, has few buttons with voice command built into it. Screen is fabulous and crisp, does justice to 1080p content on YouTube or hd on Netflix. One thing which is not par is sound quality. Primary sounds/ vocals are loud and clear but secondary backgrounds are lacking, you have to increase the volume but that reduce the over all experience. I recommend a separate Bluetooth/aux speaker with it for cinematic experience.",A great smart TV for it's price point.,B07GTD1LHY
I purchased this for my retired parents as a replacement for their 5+ year old Lyod LCD nd after using it for first time I believe the old TV was much better. I have a another Micromax led tv as well which is 10x better picture quality. I had convinced them that TVs are standard and can be bought online without any issues. But for the first time I accept their view. NEVER BUY A TV ONLINE. I Assumed this is a certified android TV from worlds acclaimed 2nd largest selling brand but the TV is horrible. The picture is soo rich in Color we have not switched it on after the first attempt. The picture even HD is grainy and dull. No amount of settings helped with improving it. Called up Amazom for return and they reminded me that I haven't gone thru their policy and TVs can be only returned after an inspection report. WHAT ARE THEIR TECHNCIIANS GOING TO INSPECT? OR RATHER WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO COMPARE WITH ? PLEASE AVOID THIS BRAND OR BUYING TV ONLINE.,Horrible picture quality.,B07GTD1LHY
Absolutely loved the price and the features. Picture quality is good and so are the smart features.,Awesome purchase,B07GTD1LHY
Finding problem with this product. Needed service support . Tv is switching off automatically and remote not working at this time to switch on. Same issue is audio sound also. Request support to solve the issue,Tv automatically switching off fequently,B07GTD1LHY
Tv is automatically switching off after some time and volume is also going to mute,TV has the issues,B07GTD1LHY
Never trusted a non brand appliance unless I bought this TCL Full HD Android TV on my friend's recommendation... It's worth every penny spent... Highly recommended and will definitely opt for other TCL appliances in future too...,Worth every penny,B07GTD1LHY
"Worked perfect for a month. The issues started with freezing every now and then, automatically turning off, bluetooth not working. Worst sound quality. You will need a pair of speakers to understand even the simple words. Bluetooth doesn't have the option to disconnect or reconnect with the paired devices. You will have to unpair and pair everytime. Now about chromecast: It will take atleast an hour to connect. In last 3 months I have been able to connect just once. The signals are weak and unstable. Customer service: Everytime you call the toll free it will land on sales team, they will arrange a follow up from the tech team, and that follow up call never came. Tried to contact amazon about the same issue, didnt help either. Conclusion: It looks fancy and cost effective but its a scrap. DO NOT BUY.",1 month USE only,B07GTD1LHY
So far so good.... Used the item for approx 1 month so satisfied with TCL smart tv.. so ordered one more for my frnd as gift. But only conc. is TCL service team they never respond. I expect this to be installed in 24 hrs but it took almost 3rd day it was get installed at my place.(NOIDA). Sport from that product is so good.TCL has to improve CX service quality.,Product awesome but service average.need improvement.,B07GTD1LHY
"Smart volume doesn't work. Voice search is not working. Try to complaint to TCL, they are very smart to handle the customer. They won't attend customer call keep says its busy. if we went to fill a complaint online their application mandatory field ""Date Purchased"" wont allow to fill the date and can not complaint. Finally we cant complaint either through call or web. Nice tricks. Also amazon just throws the ball to the customer face saying contact TCL customer care. TCL is worst in customer service.",TCL is worst in customer service,B07GTD1LHY
"Pleasantly surprised with the whole experience and the product, first time I've ordered a somewhat large appliance, took a while to have it delivered but I guess with the Amazon sale it would have taken that little extra time. Package arrived with no visible damages to the box, setup was done a couple of days later after contacting the company. TV works great but the sound could be a little better.",Great deal,B07GTD1LHY
Limited app only... We cannot install amazon prime or airtel tv.... Somethime... You will get only sound no pictures. You need to restart to get the picture.,Average product better then MI tv,B07GTD1LHY
"I am using this TV since 2 months from now, I do not see any problem. The picture quality and sound quality is really good. Some times the TV responds bit slowly when we are switching from one app to the other app. I feel that the lag is not that a big problem. Cast option and its connectivity is very fast and happens quickly. Usb ports also has a quick response with respect to pendrive or external HDD.",Value for Money,B07GTD1LHY
"At first TV was working fine, after 3-4 days it got started hanging. Google Assistant was not working. Unable to install Amazon prime and other stuff. Tried to return the TV but they did agree, they told they have some policy that not to take back. I scold them badly and explained them the whole issues. Finally they took back. Please don't go with this TV",TV is hanging too badlyy,B07GTD1LHY
The os is very slow...the remote has a lag...and it takes a lot of time to boot up... The picture quality and sound is excellent..gives what it says For the os...i finally had to buy an amazon firestick...,Fair enough,B07GTD1LHY
"I use this TV for internet purposes. First of all its takes too long to start since beginning and now when I press the menu button it now again takes lot of time. It is barely after 1 week of use. The product is too slow. As far as voice recognition is concerned, you have to sit near to the television otherwise it won't work. So I strongly recommend not to use this product.",Puneet Bansal,B07GTD1LHY
"BEST PRODUCT EVER. WE PURCHASE TCL 49"" ANDROID TV IN VERY LOW COST ON AMAZONE AND WE CONFUSED ABOUT COST COZ ANOTHER COMPANY SAME PRODUCT IS AROUND 100K LIKE SONY, VIDEOCON BUT TCL COST IS ONLY AROUND 30K BUT LAST 2 MONTHS WE OPERATING THIS TV AND WE ARE FULLY SATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT..

Putting this after 10 days of regular use. Had a tough time finding a good TV. Ordered IFALCON from Flipkart but they cheated by sending different model. Then I decided never to buy from Flipkart and IFALCON product. Found a budget deal for LED 43 inch in Amazon in terms of TCL. Second day delivery the same guys did wall mount. Amazing experience. Superb HD quality Details are great Easy to use No problem in connectivity so far Beautiful remote Volume is sufficient Little disappointed with the sound quality... Not much details and bass..... Sports mode is great though... They can improve .. But better than MI at least... Go for it at a price of 23k with 18 months warranty.. trust worthy brand,Nice deal... Satisfied.,B07GTD1LHY
Pros-superb picture quality Google approved android tv with all mordern apps No lag in switching apps Quick installation by service engineer. Cons-sound could be better Amazon prime video app missing.,Best 32 inch android TV under 15000,B07GTD1LHY

This tcl tv is exactly same as iffalcon F2A only diffrence is the logo. Recently on my iffalcon tv i got some motherboard issue and the technician changed the board now my tv boots up with tcl logo and everything remains same even the motherboard was identical.
