Don't purchase this TV waste of money Service from Kodak is worst and also from Amazon they just don't agree the problem of product. While returning this tv I faced so many problems. Tv does not support hdmi. And it shows USB option but doesn't support USB. Amazon Customer care exicetive specially female exicetive just give rude answers and let the time pass and feel like they are the owners of Amazon.,Worst tv and worst return policy,B07RJQYL97
"I'm updating this review after Four months of use. Pros: great picture quality with high brightness, A+ grade panel in this budget. Sound is good for small room or hall. Android 7.0 Preloaded Netfllix , Amazon prime video, Hotstar, Zee5, Jio Cinema & many more. Almost every necessary apps are there in App store. Works good with wifi , can connect with mobile hotspot Miracast is working good to share your mobile screen with TV. USB drive supports well. HDMI Ports are also working fine. Cons: No Bluetooth so you can't connect your Bluetooth headphones or speakers, But you can buy Bluetooth transmitter that can help to connect. Overall value for money & can go for it without thinking more. Value for money",A smart TV with great picture quality,B07RJQYL97
"Kodak 40""smart TV is excellent with Android everything is excellent picture quality , sound quality and all facilities . Very light weight and easy to carry . And the best of it is ,it's very cheap Brands are just for unnecessary ego of people . People should buy more products like this to get more and more product like this from this manufacturer . Hail Kodak . Thanks a lot .",Worth lot more than its value .,B07RJQYL97
"Bought this TV for my room specially for Netflix and Amazon Prime. Installation was done on time and the installation staff was well trained and on time. Perfect rating for that. Once the installation was complete, the channels were playing normally but the main reason because of which we had purchased the smart TV ( netflix,amazon prime play etc ) were not working at all and the apps which were pre installed were crashing. After several attempts of trying to reinstall the app or deleting the app, I finally had to give up. Started the refund process which was quite a task as its an electronic item and returning that after installation is difficult. My suggestion is rather go for some other running brand, may be like a MI tv compared to this.",A bad decision for trying this.,B07RJQYL97
"Negatives: 1. Miracast doesn't Work. There is no question of screen mirroring for your mobiles or laptops. It doesn't get connected. I tried with one plus 6t, Poco, Macbook, nothing worked. 2. Limited storage. 3. It doesn't have any Google play store. Some custom-designed AppStore is available which has limited apps. There is no option of switching the options to desktop mode especially browser, Youtube, prime video, Netflix. 4. Apps loaded are not getting updated, therefore, you forget about new options of apps. 5. You can't sign into the Google Account for enjoying the customised experience of YouTube, or even apps. 6. No security updates available & neither are OTA upgrades. There are so many things they need to set right. Positives: 1. Picture quality is just adequate. HD looks SD but that's fine at this price. Maybe because of DishTV HD. 2. Connects well to wifi. 3. The menu option is neat and less cluttered. Very easy to switch between the TV and apps. 4. Sound is loud and clear. 5. Apps work fine. 6. You can attach a wireless keyboard and mouse for browsing. Conclusion: if you have a tight budget then this TV will work wonders for you.",Good buy with max features but screen mirroring is a problem,B07RJQYL97
"After a 2 month usage, I can say that the best part of the Kodak product is the price which is THE Best in the market, and would love to add few more such as the HD Ready picture quality is good, connectivity to WiFi has no issues and so is with the installation of apps. I dint see any issue except that YouTube app will crash when used with voice search. Other than that everything is good.",Product looks promising,B07RJQYL97
I started receiving spam calls saying that you won lucky draw for buying this kodak t.v . Contact details are shared with third party.,Spam calls and late installation process.,B07RJQYL97
"First and foremost, bare in mind, even if you pay 1.5lakh for a Sony TV, you will still have some unchecked boxes in your wish list. This is subjective and context oriented issue and will differ for every individual. From my brief usage of this TV, Video quality has been good, Audio is alright, not great but if you need better sound, you can think of adding a sound bar. Feature wise, it has almost all the features I was after, though, there is no Bluetooth. Only thing a person need to remember is more than likely they will be paying more for their mobile phone and expect more from this TV. You only get what you pay for. I compared this TV with brands like TCL, Chroma, Samsung, Panasonic, etc. This TV beats TCL and Chroma by a huge margin and is still cheaper from them. Samsung and Panasonic just marginally beats this tv in Picture quality and sound, plus one or two features but for that the cost was more than 2 times of this TV. Living in a world where technology is changing at a lightening speed, I would not want to invest too much in TV and then get stuck with it. Personally, I bought this TV so I could live with it for a couple of years and then change it but now I think it will be good for about 5 years. Also, looking at the feedback, people rate TV badly just because there was issue with logistics, use your brain and don't miss-out.",FullHD Smart TV that easily compares against leading brands for a fraction of cost,B07RJQYL97
Worst purchase experience. Installation by jeeves was a nightmare. Promised installation within 48 hrs but took more than 10 days. However Amazon assured that return policy will commence only after installation or else i would have returned the tv. Jeeves should be blacklisted for their inefficieny. Comming to the tv the wi fi reception has scope for vast improvement. Sound.... Needs a home theatre for audio to be heard if few people are around. Picture quality is average,Bad experience,B07RJQYL97
"Order delivery on time and installation person arrived on time with phone appointment but he did not know how to show the installed feature of smart tv as shown in advertise on AMAZON such as NETFLIX not working inspite of log in, HOT STAR not being login, and other feature, he was unable to show any smart function except youtube, he also said that he never installed smart feature on any tv. Very bitter experience.","No hotstar log in, Netflix login but not working, installation person do not know to show the demo.",B07RJQYL97
"Recently bought this TV on Prime day sale. Will say this , For the given price of INR 8000 (including prime day discount+HDFC discount) its the best configuration you will get with all the smart features. If you compare it with Mi TV which is currently market leading smart TV, only 2 drawbacks: 1. Android Version of Kodak TV is 7.1.2, little bit outdated and no option of updating software OTA. Can be updated only offline via zip file. 2. Kodak TV doesn't have Bluetooth, but external dongle can be used. Although, i would like to emphasize on using external speakers if you have any, because default speakers of Kodak TV are not that great in terms of Bass. Rest all other aspects, Kodak is offering smart TV with all the features other brands are offering and that too within budget.",Good Product at the given price,B07RJQYL97
"TV delivered on 15th August, as per installation policy of 72 hours, not received call for installation till date and kodak customer care number is invalid. Only god will know after installation if any problem in product were to contact. Please check and revert asap.",Installation issue,B07RJQYL97
I brought tv 5days before. But no installation done.,Poor customer care in Kodak,B07RJQYL97
"Dont buy this, mine stopped working in 3 weeks and Amazon or Kodak no one is helping to fix this issue",Beware - Dont BUY,B07RJQYL97
"Arrived on time, nicely packed, nothing missing. Did not wait for installation, it is a simple plug and play TV. Connecting it took less than 5 minutes. Youtube, Netflix and other apps are built-in and function like a pro. Watched a Netflix movie without a hitch in streaming. Picture quality is superb. Sound is not the best in class though. Very lightweight, have used the table mount legs to set it up, all you need is a star screwdriver. Will update review after 3 months.",Great value TV,B07RJQYL97
Please dont buy. Cheap quantity and horrible customer support service even in metro cities. Not working only after one month of use and waiting since one month to get it repaired.,Cheap quantity and horrible customer support,B07RJQYL97
"Kodak is one of the most trusted international brand. I'm using this product for 2 weeks not faced any type of issue yet. Sound quality is fantastic, for better sound quality there's 20 w speaker is effecient for a standard room. Everything you expect from a smart TV is there to entertain you. It support thousand of application designed for smart TV like YouTube, hotstar, Netflix and it also support playstore apps. I'm using opera browser, better experience than smart phone. You can also connect mouse and keyboard. Only negative about this product is it's connectivity, there's no Bluetooth. Overall smart choice",Best Smart TV in this price range.,B07RJQYL97
No calls from Kodak for the demo as it is not Amazon's responsibilities to arrange for the demo. Got an update from Amazon that you will get a call from them in 24 hours and installation will be done. But last 72 hours no calls came in.,2 Days after purchase!!,B07RJQYL97
Smart features are too outdated Amazon prime is not there as an app When you switch to plain black channel you dont see uniform black display i saw a burned display on my TV It take time to turn on when switched on unlike other TV's I tried putting USB for listening songs it didnt play the USB inspite to 2 USB connections. No feature to start over the movie on netflix it played from half way and could start it from begining. Price is less for a reason !!,Below Average,B07RJQYL97
It’s the worst experience ever . YouTube app is not working and I have been promised by Kodak to look into it and it doesn’t happen. Nobody comes even after emailing and waiting,Worst service and product,B07RJQYL97
"There was no mentioning of Pro on the package or TV. I ordered a FUll HD TV but it is mentioned as HD TV. Picture quality is very poor and jerky. When you playback from YouTube, you can’t access menu or change picture / sound settings. During the same time I had ordered VU TV which turned out to be way better and as promised. Worst experience buying online. Not even accepting return.",Worst TV and return policy,B07RJQYL97
"One of the best budget TV ypu could get for under 10k. Picture quality is adequate, dont expect a 4k kind of display. This is a HD ready panel, so 720p is what u get. 1 thing i liked about this TV is it gives you ample settings option to tune your audio and picture quality as per your taste. I could see a huge difference in the quality after I changed my settings. BTW it has also got a eco mode which is amazing. One thing that needs improvement is Audio quality. Its Okayish, could have been better. But overall satisified. PS. I have been using all smart features(inbuilt and chromecast) since day 1 without any issues.",Good budget smart TV for under 10k,B07RJQYL97
"Please check product , before packing.",Negligence,B07RJQYL97
First one week the TV was working well but now the picture quality is very bad. The picture is showing pixels and is straining our eyes.,Bad picture quality,B07RJQYL97
a great disappointment for us . the TV which is delivered is not working at all. and nobody could respond to the complaint seriously. I think there is big mistake from the part of amazon.,delivered an item which is not working,B07RJQYL97
"Once you buy the product, you can't return it, if you don't like it. Amazon will not take any responsibility. They are saying talk to Kodak.",Don't think Kodak will make quality product,B07RJQYL97
"Purchased this TV At 15k, 1. unbelievable price for this segment 2. Sound quality is best 3. Lot of room for improvement in smart features 4. Prime video can play but have to face lots of issue in navigation 5. Jio TV doesnt run on this platform, 6. Casting feature works quite well My recommendation if you have low budget and want to enjoy features of smart TV this is best product in market considering ROI",Value for money,B07RJQYL97
"The best thing about the Tv is that it works on mobile hotspot. you can expect best features compared to sony,samsung and LG at this price range. The Picture Quality is HD and the TV works efficiently. the only lagging feature is that the language option and subtitles do not change easily in Amazon prime and you cannot sign in to google play or you-tube sign in, the Wrost is the customer service, the Installation of the TV took a long time, the agent did not arrive and has still not arrived, I had to hire some-else to install my TV, The Customer service number does not work most of the time and the agents are so lousy that they do not give good response and cut the call from their end. I'm Satisfied with the TV but the Customer Service is not Good.",Value for Money but Kodak Customer service is worst,B07RJQYL97
Product is good for a beginner smart TV. Bad service from Amazon. It was purchased under emi but the same has not been communicated to the bank.,Good product but bad service from amazon,B07RJQYL97
"Finally, I bought this TV after reading so many reviews and analysis, so I though of sharing my feedback. Here are my reviews after three months of usage, hope this would be useful for other people, Kodak is offering smart TV with all the features other brands are proposing and that too within our budget. The Eastman Kodak Company (referred to simply as Kodak) is an American technology company. Price: Value for money, as the price is very low compared to all other brands, my rating for this is 3.8/5. Sound Quality: Excellent, with and without sound bar. Connectivity: Wi-Fi connectivity is good. Miracast allows you to cast your smartphone on your TV and use it as a remote and keyboard. Google Playstore is NOT available to install apps in TV. Have to install from Kodak’s app store Preloaded with Sun NXT, YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Prime, HotStar, etc.. Negatives: ~~~~~~~~~ 1) Dolby videos no working while using SunNxt Application 2) Google Accounts blocked 3) Occasionally TV is undergoing a flickering when connected to and showing content from a Setup Box via HDMI because of some Electrical Interference, for example TV blink off and signal returns after few second when the wall switch for the fans/lights is turned on/off 4) TV flickers occasionally while swapping HDMI connected port selection via remote","Excellent TV, Value for Money",B07RJQYL97
"The look and feel of the product is not great, it feels light. Packaging was good, installation part was easy as the packaging includes nuts and stand which is easy to install, I didn't wait for the installation call and did it myself. The picture quality is more than average if viewing HD, sound quality is not that great, smart tv options work fine, have been streaming Hotstar and Netflix over wifi on TV and no issues there. Overall, a very good product for this price. Perfect if you're looking for a temporary TV till the time you have enough money to buy a Samsung UHD 50 in' 😉",Value for money,B07RJQYL97
"I got a call from a person asking to write review about my Kodak TV purchase from amazon. I told him that, the product is very good and giving value for money, but the only problem facing is , casting from mobile is is not working. Then he told that he will inform this to technical team and they will contact you. But it been three weeks after that, I haven't received any call from the concerned team.,","Good product, Casting is not working.",B07RJQYL97
"I was looking for a monitor and landed up buying this product and happy so far. Pros: Needed connectivity options and value for money. Corns: You can't expect intelligent volume adjustment for multiple sources with this price, LAN port is available but not helping (could be configurable) , but never mind you may hardly use it than wifi, HDMI, USB etc. Notification noice settings not easily found out (better a remote option) - not great to hear beep when wifi goes off/on etc. One easy improvement could be made is a built-in holder in the side or back to keep USB devices, Mobile etc when wall mounted.",Good buy and Value of money,B07RJQYL97
"For the price paid, it is a decent buy. Don't expect too much out of it though. The smart features lag a bit and the quality ia quite low, but the picture and sound quality is good enough when you use it with HD DTH or though HDMI.",Buy this if you're low on budget.,B07RJQYL97
Real experience I buy this Tv 2 Month ago I will explain my Real experience Don't Go through Fake comments in this products Because other companies person's put negative reviews....This is a good tv ...Only one word SUPERB....SIMPLY AMAZING...All Smart features..and sound clarity is superb.....In this price The product is giving company such a wonderful...Thanks to kODAK.....

"I think the product is very good, considering the price. Picture quality is very good. Feels great to watch cricket and movies. The installation was fast and the packaging was robust. The company personnel were supportive. Much better experience over leading brands who charge exorbitant prices.",Best you can get in the price range!!,B07RJQYL97
Very bad experience nobody has returned up for installation after delivery from 3 days,Installation is still pending from 3 days after delivery,B07RJQYL97
"First thing first. The TV has good picture quality and smart features for the money we have paid. It is absolutely a value for money. Sound quality is good and the connectivity features such as 3 HDMI ports, 2 RGB ports etc. are added attraction. Some further points to consider are: the internal memory is less. Also, the Android OS is very old. I am not sure how the TV would work when the OS get automatically updated.",Good value for the money paid...,B07RJQYL97
"Tv installation not done, tv received at 10th august 2019, waste product. Installation is not done. If tomorrow my tv got in problem, I think no response from company.","Waste product, no installation done",B07RJQYL97
"Smart features work, but picture quality is not good, Black is not Black in the picture its show little bit Gray... personally I not like its contrast ratio.....",Don't waste your money.....,B07RJQYL97
"Unabale to give single star.never buy this , very bad quality of product. No service. Trying to return but no response from Amazon.",Disatisfied,B07RJQYL97
"Affordable, overall a good experience. Smart features are average for basic apps, this is not an Android TV. No Bluetooth for headphone or speaker use. Sound is good enough, picture is above average quality. Connectivity options are good enough. Remote control and smart interface identical to Thomson brand made by the same factory. Brightness level is very good.",Overall it is a good experience..,B07RJQYL97
Some time screen goes black,Response,B07RJQYL97
"When I started using the TV it felt off, I've used Mi TVs at friend's place and the picture quality looked very amazing and sound was good too. I used YouTube not so great even though it was playing in Full HD, Tried Netflix the app hanged, Tried Amazon Prime (Had to install seperately) same result of bad picture quality. Then I found out the custom android version this TV is using is really bad, like unimaginably bad. Picture Quality 4.5/5: As soon as I hooked my PS4 to the TV the real picture quality of the TV came to life, all the games, YouTube, Netflix, Prime Video, Crunchyroll everythting looked stunning. Picture Quality, Sharpness, Contrass, Brightness, Color Reproduction everything was just Wow. For me I didn't really saw any difference in picture quality between Mi TV, Vu and Kodak, TCL is very slightly better so slight that it won't be notisable. Don't judge pircure quality of this TV based on the apps installed on TV, try pen drive, laptop, console, ChromeCast or FireTV to see the panel come to life and deliver what's expected. P.S it even supports HDR output from PS4. Sound 4/5: This is where this TV excells, it has Optical Output, ARC, and the build in speakers are a blast(as compared to mediocore speakers on rest of the TVs). Speakers are loud and clear enough to not require a seperate soundbar, obviously there is very little bass but hey did you ever expected bass out of TV speakers Smart Features 1/5 : Smart features of this TV are killing the good picture and sound quality it has. Major cons are Old android version. Custom android which doesn't allow you to install apps on play store and Kodak AppStore doesn't load properly all the time. Old version of apps cannot be updated via Play Store or the Kodak Appstore Home screen is not customizable, neither of screens (Music, video, movie) are. Can change Location (Hydrabad was the default location for wateher services on my TV) YouTube looks mediocre , cannot login into YouTube. Netflix looks mediocre and hangs 80% of the time Prime Video is not available by default but if you manage to install from Kodak Appstore, video is again mediocre , app is bound to hang. All the apps are of mobile version maybe which is the reason video looks crappy on all of them. Only good thing is this is compatible with Keyboard and Mouse kudos to that.",Amazing HDTV but Really! BAD SMART TV,B07RJQYL97
"This LED TV is average in all departments. It does not excel in any particular department, however, considering the selling price, it is worth every rupee spent. It is a feature rich TV. The installation was carried out by the Technician from Jeeves Consumer Services who were appointed by the manufacturer. There was a delay in installing the TV beyond promised 48 Hrs. It was difficult to contact the manufacturer and the installer to schedule the technicians visit. However, after I posted the grievance on Manufacturer's website they contacted me immediately and informed me that they were facing technical difficulties, which led to the delay. It has been a few day since we have been using the TV and have not faced any problems with the product. The TV, pretty much, does everything that is listed in the TV's features.",Worth the money spent,B07RJQYL97
Ok.. Fine.. Kodak led 40 inch overall super... Full hd... Pro... First day only I connected to mob hot spot and watch a movie in you tube... Full clear.. Very happy.. in DTH it's ok... So upgrade to hd channel. Definitely its high resolution in it's cost. Kodak Costomer care also contacted me immediately. Overall good budget tv. We can update apps. In some reviews told update not available but it is ther. In app store we can update,Suuuuper..,B07RJQYL97
Sound not good no quality but value for money in this range of it is better that Kodak have to give a Dolby digital plus sound in TV But all over is good,Waste of money and as quality as money u keep,B07RJQYL97
TV is as good as described on Amazon. Very good features at this price. Picture and Sound quality are good. All features working as promised. Only issue being with the customer care. My TV was delivered on 29-Sep-2019 and I had to chase the customer care every day to get it installed until 07-Oct-2019. The customer care department has no clue about the installation status and it seems to be managed by a person other than the customer care. Very bizarre setup.,"Good product for the price, but issues with customer care",B07RJQYL97
After a nearly a month use it's working just fine but the miracast feature isn't working,Miracast isn't working,B07RJQYL97
This T.V is hanging,My complain,B07RJQYL97

"I have done fairly good research on competitive brands and decided on Kodak after concluding it as the most economical and bundled with rich features. In fact in this year this is the third one I am buying for the use of my organization, though I am not using TV by myself!",Very Economical with Rich Features,B07RJQYL97
"No smart features are working on it even no YouTube is paying , each app is chashing while opening..","No smart features are working , even YouTube is crashing before opening",B07RJQYL97
"It's overall a good TV for the the price. The smart features are good, but it would have been better if there was an easier way to access the apps. The main problem is picture optimization. It doesn't readgust the picture to fit the screen properly. U have to go the settings and play around with setting for almost each different video input. Also i did the main installation myself (it's not difficult), as the installation people from the company took a few days to come. Also they have no idea of the settings for the TV which u have to do urself.","Good, only a few minor issues. But Great for Price.",B07RJQYL97
Bought this 32 inch TV 1 month ago and since it is working absolutely fine. No issues at all delivery was quick but installation took 2 days. Actually there is nothing to install u can wall mount it yourself if u have drilling machine. For installation it costs rs 400 more. Bought this for rs 9000 but it's worth every penny. Now in this festival sale it is costing rs 8100. Picture quality is perfect even in non hd channel when using Tata sky. I have posted a pic of the same. Sound quality is ok not that kind which is required to dance in a big hall. Smart TV features are working fine. WiFi detection is good. And downloading apps from play store is flawless. Ab 9000 me aur Kya chayea. MI se to bhaut aacha hai. MI mehenga hai and dusri baat Chinese company hai Kodak ka TV is made in india,Worth each penny. Awesome TV,B07RJQYL97
"We wanted something that is economical yet rich in features and Kodak TV fits the bill perfectly. you will need fast internet to fully enjoy the smart bit of it. Also, it doesn't take much effort to setup support from kodak is available in case you need to wall mount the tv. they call you the same day or the next day of delivery to fix up an appointment with you. you will have to adjust the display settings to your liking to get the best results. Please don't compare it to top-end models of other brands and criticize as it does what it says on the box. my phone camera is not so good hence the blurry image. Movies play nicely from USB and support subtitles as well. I use it with firestick as I have got used to it the onboard smart features are suitable as well.",Best Led at this price point,B07RJQYL97
Mirror cast does not supported at all picture quality is also not very good.,An cheap tv,B07RJQYL97
This is a very cheap quality product. The screen looks to be a recycled one and the body is definitely made of a recycled plastic. It may break if you press it normally. The Kodak company response to the calls wasn't appropriate. Customer communication needs to be evolved. The call center for installation is dubious. Overall I think they will not be in business for long. No process in place. Don't buy it.,Don't buy you will regret,B07RJQYL97
THINK 100 times before by this product. Worst service from brand and amazon home services.,Not worth for single star too.,B07RJQYL97
"Picture quality is not bad,sound is ok overall good experience in this Price range",Good deal for this price,B07RJQYL97
"Pros: Value for money. Found it worth the money spent. Smooth free installation. Great sound and picture quality. App store has most of the popular subscription apps. Cons: Lacks bluetooth connectivity. Have to struggle in some apps with the cursor. Remote lacks the buttons directly for Netflix, Prime, etc.",Value for money !!,B07RJQYL97
It's not upto the mark...plastics r cheap..remote plastic quality also cheap Pay more and buy a better oroduct,Cheap plastics,B07RJQYL97
"Do not buy. Not recommended. It has been more than 15 days i bought the tv, and no response from installation team. I am tired of complaining to their customer care. Even calling the customer care is a hassle, their IVR machine starts talking after connecting the call and either disconnects by itself or does not connect to customer service representative. The tv is still kept in the box. No use",Not recommended. No service at all,B07RJQYL97

"Pathetic service by Kodak, even the 7 days paased after the delivery, No installation help was provided by Kodak. I called the helpline number provided on amazon- 18001033036 And 180030002228 Neary thousand times, but no response. They do not pick up the phone, it keeps ringing. If u are lucky enough then only ur call will be picked once after 100 of tries. They provide another number 9711248287 and this person never picks up the phone.

I have tried India Today and Fox News apps. - Navigation is bit confusing. - Display of small letters is blurry. - Best customer support. Technician he himself called me and came to my home for installation. - Its MRP was Rs. 21,000. On offer it was priced at Rs. 9,000. I have purchased it with exchange of old LCD with final price of Rs. 6,500. - Value for Money - Good for guest rooms or children bedrooms where there is a limited usage.",Value for Money,B07RJQYL97
Excellent Buy at this price segment I think its the best LED SMART TV. Highly Recommended Good Crisp Display Excellent and vibrant colors Good picture quality Ease of use Good Sound quality Brand Value Wifi Connectivity light weight,Good Buy highly Recommended,B07RJQYL97
"Its my first led tv that too smart led tv. delivery time is long. Easy installation processs. Tv is very light weight. You can hang it on wall and can place it on table. Picture quality is good. But not best as i had experienced in samsung and sony. with hd channels only picture quality is super. Sound is also good. But all sound and picture is dependent on your cable and like media you are using like full hd downloads of high gb. Using smart features needs high speed internet for smooth functioning like for youtube. For hotstar we need to purchase its premium account. Smart features ke liye sabka extra charge h for netflix etc and needs high speed net. Last one month se tv badhiya chal raha h koi dikkat nahi h Hd channels ka print picture quality bahut badhiya h. Sound bhi bahut badhiya h. Mira cast se supporting mobile connect hota h easily but aapko har bar connect karne se pehle we have to remove kodaktv from remembered group in wifi direct option under settings, otherwise it will not connect with your mobile. I purchased it in 15500 with 10% instant discount with sbi card. So overall is rate me best product h. Demo given was not proper and knowledge of demo man was inadequate. He had poor knowledge of connectivity and of screen cast. He advised me to purchase a wifi router for connecting mobile to tv. Didnt give proper demo of all functions of tv. Usb port sab tv ke peeche h ab tv wall pe lag gayi to usb connect karne ki problem h. Otherwise usb connectivity good h. For this u have to purchase wall mount seperately.",Super in this price.,B07RJQYL97
"This is my 1st negative fdbk/ review because I believe in positive karma but I've had enough of ""rules of amazon"" 1. Even after paying in full You can't open the tv til the installation guy opens himself OR THEY WON'T HONOR THE WARRANTY 2. Installation guy didn't Call/Msg For 3days which was Like a nightmare. Wenever I called amazon or kodak, standard predrafted answer was ""sir calmly wait. We will Call You in 48 WORKING hrs(working hrs being d operative word_That can b stretched upto 7days depending on holidays) so u can only curse them but can't kill them 3. There Should a strict policy of nxtday installation or return the tv. Hell yaaaa ! I've paid in full N It's my tv. Y Should I wait at the mecy of some installatiin guy who doesnt bother to Call For 3days ? 4. NOW ABT THE TV_ It's an Avg HD tv. Colors are too vivid so every chnl, u'hv to manually set the color which is too annoying 5. USB slot is totally hidden at the back n 100% unreachable until You take it out of the bracket. So everytime It's the same parade if You wanna insert a pen drive_not atall user freindly :( OVERALL, this time the experience was pathetic",Not happy :(,B07RJQYL97

Now I am going to return this useless product. Guys never buy this tv very bad customer service,Very poor customer service ever,B07RJQYL97
Received the product in good condition and timely manner. Stand legs were easily screwed in and right away was able to connect to WiFi and start watching YouTube content right. Later tried casting from smartphone which also worked. Follow up service for installation by technician was declined by me as it was not needed. Trying to key in search items laborious with TV controller but text prediction helps. Yet to try watching Amazon Prime content on this device. Volume of speakers and surprisingly loud but controllable with clear sound quality. Would recommend this to other potential buyers.,Easy installation and great for watching internet content.,B07RJQYL97

The TV is actually ruined the Kodak brand. The picture quality is ok. Smart features are not user friendly and have to configure the mirroring option everytime which is really time consuming. It is not supporting voice command at all which is a basic thing in any smart TV. You can not write the content every time you are searching for and voice command would have helped this TV at least. Overall so so TV but good but at 7000/-.,"Kodak 32"" HD smart tv .. So so ok but good buy at 7k",B07RJQYL97
"I never expected such a great and smart TV in this price. Amazing picture quality with various mode like vivid, soft and many more. You can download many apps as it has inbuilt memory. YouTube is preinstalled. Beautiful HD quality picture. It can give competition to many costly brands.",In this budget go for it,B07RJQYL97
"Too good product at a steal! I can't really believe this 32"" Smart HD LED TV came for only 9k at Diwali sale Picture quality excellent Sound Quality and clarity excellent User friendly interface, even the elderly members of our family have learnt to switch between cable TV and Wifi streaming quite easily and quickly. and Search has brought about a mini revolution in the way we watch TV.","Super Led tv, Value for money",B07RJQYL97
"Reviewing after 3months usage. Total failure as a smart TV. If you just want this as a TV with a light smart feature you can go for it. Pros- 1. The UI interface for smartTV is simple to understand and navigate. 2. Sound and picture quality is good. 3. Good for Youtube/Netflix/hotstar/jio movie 4. Has inbuilt Miracast but can only be used if u have a local wifi network. I tried with mobile hotspot and it didn't work. 5. Connects fast to saved wifi when power on. But after some months usage connection seems glitchy( connects n disconnects etc) Cons- It's all about the smart feature 1. Does not have Google play store installed. Even if you try to install via play store in browser , install stalls. I had to download app every time and install manually. Really a pain. But the TV has its own app store which has very minimal useful apps. So every time u have to rely on download app n install. 2. The default browser Is a disaster (scroll issue)and u can't change the default. Downloaded Firefox for Android TV which is good. 3. The smartTv Settings has limited functions and does not give the full power for Android TV usage like in other smart TVs 4. YouTube voice search crashes every time and u r stuck with typing for every YouTube search. 5. The TV has scroll issues. Better to use a wireless mouse. 6. Connected my mobile using usb and it didn't detect. Only pendrive works. Final verdict- This TV is good for anyone looking for a normal tv and an entry level smart TV experience.",Disappointing SmartTv features,B07RJQYL97
It's an excellent TV which great picture and sound quality. I had some queries about TV but thanks to Mr Shohrab who listen to my queries patiently and rectified them.,Excellent TV,B07RJQYL97
TV came without any wall. Mounting. I was charged Rs 1000 extra by the Kodak TV installation team. Kodak helpline was unavailable. When I complained to Amazon they gave an email address for Kodak which was also not working. Pathetic service by amazon when they have committed to facilitating instalation on the products description. Amazon executives in chat are even hesitant to give out their full names or email. Really hard to communicate with Amazon for this kind of a product and its installation.,TV came without wall mount. Customer care numbers are wrong.,B07RJQYL97
Based on budget it is good Sound quality not that much better,Good,B07RJQYL97
I am not happy with this product as i got few color dots on display and black spots in display. I know for this price we cannot expect perfect but not the compromised display.

I order so many in amazon weekly 2 or 3 items...,Kodak 80 cm (32 inches) HD Ready LED Smart TV 32HDXSMART,B07RJQYL97
"Kodak is one of the most trusted international brand. I'm using this product for 1 Month not faced any type of issue yet. Sound quality is fantastic, for better sound quality there's 20 w speaker is effecient for a standard room. Everything you expect from a smart TV is there to entertain you. It support thousand of application designed for smart TV like YouTube, hotstar, Netflix and it also support playstore apps. I'm using opera browser, better experience than smart phone. You can also connect mouse and keyboard. Only negative about this product is it's connectivity, there's no Bluetooth. Overall smart choice",A smart TV with great picture collety,B07RJQYL97
"I wrote this review after 30 days usage of Kodak smart TV. Picture quality is ok range, sound quality is also good. Smart feature are also awesome the tv alows you download the app in app store only. If voice control remote provided along this tv means maybe added value.. My suggestion is just go through the tv if your budget 10k range..",Review after 30 days usage,B07RJQYL97
"I'm writing this review after one month of use. Pros: great picture quality with high brightness, A+ grade panel in this budget. Sound is good for small room of hall.

"Tv is good at a reasonable price, but there are hell load of cons to it.. first of all the kodak customer care no. Provided 180030002288 turned out to be the wrong one, however as per Amazon customer service rep, that is the only no. To reach kodak... Second of all the YouTube app worked for few mins n den stopped working after trying all the ways to fix the issue.. Yet to find for the other apps.. Its hard time to reach the kodak customer service for the installation... If all these issues are fixed i would prefer to rate the product 4 out of 5",Buy at your own risk,B07RJQYL97

"I had very bad experience, first the customer care number is not at all reachable. Eamil also not responded at all.

"The Kodak Company's 9-inch television was taken at Amazon Navratri Festival from May to November, but the delivery of the television was absolutely negative, but one thing that was very negative was that there was no reply from the Kodak Company's toll fee number regarding private install / television.

I'm writing this review after 10 days of usage. This TV is working fine sofar. Sound and Picture quality is awesome. Miracast is working good. Light weight.

"Arrived on time, nicely packed, nothing missing. Did not wait for installation, it is a simple plug and play TV. Connecting it took less than 5 minutes. Youtube, Netflix and other apps are built-in and function like a pro. Watched a Netflix movie without a hitch in streaming. Picture quality is superb. Sound is not the best in class though. Very lightweight, have used the table mount legs to set it up, all you need is a star screwdriver.",Product is nice at given price. Fully worth of cost.,B07RJQYL97
This smart TV is really best at its price range. This has very good picture quality. This would have been even more better if it has Bluetooth facility. However it needs some improvement on audio quality because sometimes audio automatically goes off and has to restart the TV for solving the problem. TV remote consumes more battery because whenever power goes off remote is required everytime for starting TV. Despite these minor shortcomings this TV is superb at its price range.,Best smart TV in economy price range.,B07RJQYL97

"After the installation guy visited, he found the product defective. So he said somebody from brand will come to replace the product. Since then no body connected to us.
