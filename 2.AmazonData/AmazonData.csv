"Today, it got delivered. Talked to Amazon Customer Service - Due to its cheap build-up quality, I wanted to return this TV (even at this price range its pathetic). Amazon denied to return it. This is the first time(in last 3 years), it ever happened with me on Amazon. I feel cheated and I will make sure Amazon will also feel the Pain. They aren't the only one in the Market.",Cheap Product with Cheap customer service by Amazon,B06XGWRKYT
"Got it for 20500. First order had to be replaced because of broken screen. Volume is good. Tv is good enough for this price range. Simplistic remote. Plays most formats. Usb are at side in back. Hdmi at the back. Bought it to play my PS3. So no complaints there. Got wall mount but prefer the stand. When I played some movies from blue ray format via USB, the clarity is not that great. But TV HD is good enough as any other TV. Full value for money. Bit heavy at 10 kg. My needs are met so very happy.",Fits the value.,B06XGWRKYT
"Great value and quality compared to other TV brands that are in the market. So far very satisfied with delivery, installation and demo. My suggestion is outer packaging quality should be improve as the package design and quality is inferior than what is used in other TV brands I have received as I feel this would reduce damage to the TV that could happen during transportation. Also free wall mount stand which is an added bonus along with free installation. I have using this for less than a week and so far all is good",Great Value !!!,B06XGWRKYT
"This TV maybe LED as in 'technically LED'. The picture quality is worse than a monitor I bought about 9-10 years ago. The viewing angles are terrible. The technician wall mounted the thing before I checked this. My fault. Now, I can't have a sofa that sits low. The sound quality is below average as well. Even if Kodak had spent Rs 300 on the speakers (reference Bluetooth speakers in smaller packages), they could have got something extremely good. But I suppose that's too much to ask for. I can't complain about the input ports though. Even more expensive models come with less. Edit: Having used it for a couple of weeks, I bumped up the stars by 1 more. It's good for DTH TV (considering the lower broadcast quality). Not so great for movies and such. I'd not subscribe to HD Channels (SD should do fine). 2 month update (or close to): I have an urgent wish from Kodak. The volume levels between 4 and 5 needs to be standardized. 4 is low enough that I need to rely on subtitles and 5 is too high to use when your child is asleep even in another room. Could you fix this through an update? 2 month update: A Kodak technician came over yesterday and looked over the 2 issues I had reported (volume from 4-->5 & picture quality is mostly leaning towards red). He mentioned that all TVs have this problem about the volume. This is not my experience from buying other brands. Regarding the reddish appearance, he mentioned that the panel is only capable of so much. That a 30Hz display will not do much more and I use Soft or Medium settings for Streaming sticks. Personally, I've come to the conclusion that my attempts at resolving these issues are all that I could hope for. I won't be trying any more. Just use it for what best I could for the next couple of years.",Might do for an urgent need. Spend more for a better panel,B06XGWRKYT
I would request everyone please don't buy this product... quality is worst..I have purchased this TV before two months and it is not working now screen has blurred automatically...and after sale service is even Masha Allah..no one is gonna help you out..you will be not able to contact with Kodak...no one will replay your mails... they will take a long time to repair ur TV... Overall experience was too much frustrating.,Worst product...don't purchase it,B06XGWRKYT

"Worked for 15 days. Before last day of scheduled return , picture gone. Returned and got full refund.. Not satisfied with this purchase.",Not satisfactory,B06XGWRKYT
"Out of out performance. After using the TV from last three days the screen is blank and customer care department is not taking any complaint for repair giving reason that I have lost the invoice copy. If I have lost the invoice the company should have there own record of customers. I am using various brands like Sony Bravia tv, Hitachi air conditioner, ifb washing machine but never faced such problem. Harassing",More than expected,B06XGWRKYT
Very bad quality.The service center is good for nothing. No proper response ever. I m trying since one and half month for a part replacement and still the struggle persists.. The product is simple waste of money. Better donate your money to an NGO rather buying any Kodak Daba piece.. zero rating...,Poor quality product,B06XGWRKYT
Worthy product. good service Sound quality good. Picture quality best,Good product,B06XGWRKYT
"Got at a good price. The TV is functioning well. The image is crisp and clear. There are a lot more features to be checked. A star less for not getting any call for installation. Happy to use this, hope it doesn't have any issue. Will update review post a few months of usage.",Bought it because it was reasonable and it was from Kodak. Trust factor.,B06XGWRKYT
"Worst TV ever . Poor quality. Display gone in just 3 month of purchase and the above all no response from the kodak customer care. No revert on mails, customer care call not picked and autodisconncted after holding for 5 to 10 min. Dear Amazon request you to block such type of product on your platform as it's affecting you also as you also could not help in this matter as you also told that we can't do anything till Kodak not responded.",Worst TV ever the poorest after service,B06XGWRKYT

Why to go for high budget costly tv's when we have our Kodak TV range. Me and my father will not go by brand we were checking for 50 inch low budget but reliable and we found Kodak tv and i am really happy with my purchase. Its been 3 months since the purchase so i am wrting this review after usge. My recommendation is to go 100% value for money.,Best and value for money extreemly happy.,B06XGWRKYT
"Buy only if you're capable of installing it on your own.. Don't expect Kodak to install... Product is good, but based on installation delay I hope service will be poor. Still now it's ok for this price, picture quality is medicore.. Sound performance is not up to mark..",No installation,B06XGWRKYT

"Dont purchase this tv,only the price is less. We didn't get any service. 16days before I had register the compliant I didn't get any replay form company side.validity of a Kodak led is 3 months only.",How can we record the programs?,B06XGWRKYT
"Terrible picture quality. I regret this purchase. Stay away. Installation from the Kodak team was 2 weeks late. (fyi it's installed by Ask Jevees, a subsidiary of Flipkart.)",Don't Buy Kodak TVs,B06XGWRKYT
"Kodak had already built a name in photography, so I was sure I wouldn't be disappointed chosing kodak. Pros 1) value for money! For under 25k, this TV is a screaming buy! 2) sound quality is good, loud, clear, does have some disturbance at volumes over 85-90, but you'll never need to put the volume so high. 3) Three power saving modes - lower energy usage 4) very light weight! Can easily move around, lift / relocate 5) 2 years warranty! Which is extendable! Recommend taking an extra year 6) VGA port + hdmi port- so you can connect newer devices plus all your old laptops, and use this as a replacement for laptop screen 7) good picture quality, should be sufficient for most Cons 1) USB ports on the bottom are inaccessible unless TV is lifted up, You'll have to make do with the ones on side - which are accessible with minimal difficulty Would have preferred a more easily accessible solution for usb ports and hdmi Debatable 1) colour - had some issues with colour reproduction especially noticeable with photos - but ok for movies, and videos Mostly needs tweaking with colour /saturation /contrast/brightness,especially with dark scenes Preset modes are not useful 2) smart vs non - smart - I got an android box with a non smart TV, coz the smart tvs have lower specs - ram and storage capacity. I'd suggest the same. I'd suggest getting an amazon fire stick with this. Verdict : go for it, I don't see how the premium models will beat it sufficiently to justify the price","Value for money, recommended",B06XGWRKYT
Please beware that the offer of the fire tv stick is a fraudulent one. the Amazon co is playing very tricky to avoid the customer using the offer...its completely cheat . but the TV is good for the price,Cheating Offer,B06XGWRKYT
As per my experience KODAK TV IS VALUE FOR MONEY but picture quality show more magenta (red) color. Panel quality is not good. Sound is average. I am use this for PC purpose specially 3 HDMI and VGA port. So finally panel and picture quality is upset to me.,Less than expectations.,B06XGWRKYT
"- In this price range, its a good buy. - Sound is loud enough. - Picture quality is fine. No point to compare it with high range TVs. I am happy, as it's best buy over purchasing a LED monitor for laptops.",Good buy,B06XGWRKYT
If you have used any of the top brands like Samsung or sony Don’t go for this Because picture and sound quality is terribly bad For this price point it is still not good I could have gone for 32 inch Sony rather than this 50 inch crap for the same price,Poor picture and sound quality,B06XGWRKYT
Plse don't buy this TV. Kodak Co. Servicing was very poor. They are not installation in proper time after 10days they are installing my TV. And not buy any product in Amazon.,Very bad servicing,B06XGWRKYT
Not a good product. The panel board got damaged within 6 months of use. The service center is slack and outsourced. God knows when do they replace the TV. I am upset. Amazon should push the Kodsk huys to render prompt service.,AV Narayanan from kochi,B06XGWRKYT
if you are looking for a decent led tv with large screen size I would recommend this as a value for money buy. Picture quality is decent enough and it surprisingly it supports almost all video formats which you can play using an usb drive. 1080p videos also play good with nice picture quality. Sound quality is a bit on poorer side and you need to use an extra pair of speakers. Im using this for 2 weeks now and satisfied so far.,Value for money,B06XGWRKYT

"TV was installed by Kodak's representative only after 13 days from the date of delivery. Contacting Kodak Customer care is a nightmare. Always on recorded message. Even if someone answered the call, they simply ask me to wait for a 48 hours or 72 hours more for installation. Do not provide any Service request number. After much persuasion, the TV was finally installed after the expiry of 10 days allowed by Amazon for return. However, the quality of TV is poor. Poor clarity and poor audio. Color is more reddish.

Full HD: for casual use you won't have any problems. Sound quality is a little average, lacks bass - so not great for a large room. For a bedroom or a small to medium living room its perfect.

"The tv is decent value for money. The issue is that the picture is washed out and does not provide the level of clarity I was expecting.

"It's got all the basic features at a good price. Decent quality. Sound is good. Picture color or tone can get drab depending on what video source you are viewing, say streaming. Might help you to know that it DOES have a VGA port at least the piece I received - unlike the pics on the Amazon listing which shows an extra USB port where the VGA port is. The installation through Jeeves service was fine too - but it doesn't include a swivel. You will have to prearrange that, I suppose. I wasn't looking for any fancy features, just anything adequate. From that kind of perspective, a good buy.",Value for money. Got all the basic goodies.,B06XGWRKYT

When I enquired customer service regarding this, their answer was 'Our TV doesn't support .mkv format and supports only .mp4 format'. We are in 2019 and they say it won't support .mkv format. I feel like I am in 2009 when DVD players don't support these formats. They have assured they will talk to management and come up with a solution. Let me see what they are going to do. Installation was very late and it was done 3 weeks after delivery. I contacted customer care several times to get it done.

"Review after using it 2 days: Purchased this TV on Amazon Summer Sale at a price of 6299(with card discount). At such a low price point, this is Incredible. Unable to believe that LED TV's are so cheap right now. For those, who are complaining that the display looks reddish, need to decrease the Saturation level, It'll be fine after that. Play with Brightness, Contrast, saturation and sharpness to get the perfect Image You're looking for. My suggestion is to keep Brightness -45, contrast- 40,saturation-25, sharpness-30. Let me give it's Pros and Cons Pros: 1. Good Packaging. 2. Ultra fast Delivery(Thanks to Amazon) 3. Display looks Great 4. Excellent Audio. 5. Dirt Cheap 6. 2 HDMI and USB ports. 7. Aux/ 5.1 Channel Home theater supported. 8. Installation Done within 24 hours. Cons: 1. Display is not Factory Calibrated, You need to Adjust the display(Brightness/Contrast/Saturation/Sharpness). 2. Remote is not very clicky and Batteries are not provided with remote.(I had to rush to the nearest store for the battery while installing the TV) Manufacturers need to provide that. 3. IR sensor of the remote is weak, You need to point the remote to the TV then it'll work, It does not work in case IR sensor is facing any other direction. 4. Volume is not much effective after 50, There is a Huge different between 30 and 50 but there is minor differences between 50 and 100.(Almost No change between 50-75) 5. CS team of Kevin don't looks professional, they don't even have basics CS Skills. This is a pretty new item and those are my Initial Observations. In case i notice something else, I'll update it here. Hope you found this review a helpful one, Have a nice day!",Good Budget TV,B072QD8QKL
there is noting to say about tv because its everything is fine. dodnt jurge it by its price realy a nice tv,fabuluse,B072QD8QKL
"A genuine review. This tv is really nice. Picture quality really really good. Bright colours, clear picture, etc Sound is very loud and audio quality is good. 5 types sound adjustments so set as per our needs. At 40 % sound is also very loud. Clear crisp quality. Keep suround sound option off for best results. I feel display is ips i mean made of plactic type which is durable. My child taps hands many times on the tv screen and i feel the screen is durable and strong. As the name says yes the display is led. 2 hdmi 2 usb works perfectly. Tried google chromecast works with an ease. Usb port dectection is fast and easy. Usb data transfer is easy when 2 usb storage device connected . Have tried and worked perfectly. No manual needed. Little common sense and all setup is easy. Side buttons also durable. Tv really light weight. Even a small kid can lift is like a toy. Best part is tv made in india than also i assure the quality of this product is really really worth and good. One can opt to buy the tv without thought.",Wonderful product.,B072QD8QKL
"the item received on 3rd november , For installation phoned to kevins customer care number a lot. Till now we didn't get them.customer care service is very poor.",kevin's customer care service,B072QD8QKL
"First impression was how light it was like a feather because last tv is also of 24'' but too heavy but when i unboxed kevin 24'' i was really felt very light . and the picture quality is also good compared to few other brands and the most important thing is sound output its really good like a sound bar , as i took this tv for my parents who like small tv for their bedroom it suits for my budget and over all a well designed product for affordable price.",ಅತ್ಯದ್ಭುತ......SuperB.......,B072QD8QKL
"After 3months usage Easily carrying,very light weight,HD QUALITY,Good Contrast Great picture Quality(use HDMI cable with Hd set-up box) and Sound bar is Amazingly Dolby Home theatre like sound experience, very loud sound,Pendrive support- Pictures,movies (mkv format also) ,Freeze option is Good,Can be connected to Pc also Ports:-2USB,2HDMI, VGA, Headphone jack,video game ports Technician who fitted my TV said this TV is much better than Mi TV 4c pro Delayed installation and average quality service. But Customer service from company side are better than I expected. Verdict:- Inspite of going for Android TV 32inch with 2gb ram better go for KEVIN and buy Chromecast/Firestick/JioGigafiber becoz an android TV costs additional 8k-9k extra with less usable features",Upgrade your CRT TV with Kevin,B072QD8QKL
This is called perfection of sound and picture quality at very reasonable price. After using 3 month I am giving this review that this is the best TV at this price you will never get any other in market at less price with best quality also.,Its perfect TV..,B072QD8QKL
1. It's look nice & stylish due to bottom speaker. 2. Sound quality also decent compared to others brand. 3. Picture quality avarage. At last we can say that it's not a bad deal if we look on the price and warrenty. In Dewali offer on 2018 I got this only ₹4990 and 2 years warrenty. Thank you.,Good Quality According To The Price Point,B072QD8QKL
Value for money product . Picture quality and sound is good. However there is a constant thumping sound when external speakers are connected. Solved the problem by directly connecting the external speakers to set top box. TV is working fine till date.,Performance meets price,B072QD8QKL
"Overall a good basic TV to view HD channels.Good picture clarity and sound clarity. Normal channels also appear good but recommend to use hd connection to view channels in high clarity. Value for money . 1) Value for money 2) Speaker quality is good. 3) Picture quality is great. 4) Standard build quality. 5) Best connectivity. 6) Easy to handle. 7) Don't know why people goes for Sony, Samsung or LG with more cost. I agree the fact that there's no other TV better than this one in this price range. Don't think, go for it.",Great television with nice sound and clarity ...,B072QD8QKL
"I got this TV at an unbelievable price. This product is definitely worth the money. It might not be comparable to Sony, Samsung not LG but the kind of money they charge is definitely not worth the extra quality they offer. The only complaint is that no one came to install the TV but all necessary pieces to mount the TV on wall are in the box, it took me a total of 20 minutes to mount the TV on my own. If you are looking for a quality product and you are not part of the top 100 richest list then a good buy.",A quality product,B072QD8QKL
So I am writing this review after using the TV for 3months. The sound of the tv has gone off and I have been calling the customer service of Kevin For last 5days and they have not been able to arrange a technician to check my TV. Really bad. Have put up a complain on consumer forum too as the call centre representatives just keep saying technical issue can't check details or dey keep apologizing for no technician availability.... Disgusting....,Pathetic,B072QD8QKL
I am using past 3 months. The HD picture quality is awesome and sound also super. I recommend to purchase this TV Under 8k.,Fantastic LED TV,B072QD8QKL
"Kevin has made definitely a good product. There are 2 32 inch HD tvs available from Kevin on Amazon. One is at 8490 and other is at 9490. Looks to be both are same variants. So if you buy 8490 TV in the same you can get it for 7000-8000 after discounts. 32inch TV under 8000 is really a surprise. I am pleased by the quality of the TV for the price. Pros: very economical, good quality, light weight, sound and picture quality are excellent for the price range. And I received 2 year warranty during the sale. Cons: I don't find any as of now. I received a defective remote, though I had some issues with Amazon, Kevin is very prompt in resolving the issue. They have replaced the remote with in 4 days.",Affordable 32 inch led TV from Kevin/beston,B072QD8QKL

"Don't expect too much while your keeping so less price. For this price, the product is more than suitable. Got it and used for 5 months and reviewing. Till now no issue.

"Picture quality and sound are better than many top brands. And I purchased in just 6300 with 10% HDFC Discount whereas many top brands are of 14k and more for 32""",Tremendous Purchase,B072QD8QKL
"Its okay for the price paid, I missed buying this repeatedly when the price and exchange offers and card discounts were the best in the first Amazon Festival Sale. Finally bought it for 5490/- under exchange for old 21"" CRT TV. Picture and sound is okay and I bought Sennheiser HD 206 headphones to use with this TV but I find the sound quite low and really have to up the volume in both the set-top box remote and the TV remote. Might be a problem with the Sennheiser headphone though. Have played movies through USB flash drive (MKV/AVI formats) and they play okay. Now am using it mainly for standard definition cable through Hathway set-top box. Made in India so looking forward to good service for supporting national effort.",Made in India,B072QD8QKL

"As usual it was fantastic delivery by Amazon !! In time as promised. Thanks Amazon for keeping their reputation. I was surprised by customer support of Kevin. After receipt of TV and asking for installation, TV was installed within 2 hours !!! Support engineers are so enthusiastic and knowledgeable for installation and presentation of TV. We at our family were very brand cautious. I purchased TV after reading reviews, specifications on Amazon. I can say the product is superb. I am using it for 15 days now and connected to dish TV. The picture quality, sound was really good. The best I liked is the viewing angle. We at our family can view TV from any angle with the same quality. Thanks Kevin for such a wonderful product. I hope the product will work for at least 2-3 years without any problems. My suggestion is just go for it and purchase. You will never regret your decision.",Superb TV !!,B072QD8QKL
"The TV was bought just a month back. so far its performance seems to be satisfactory, as I did not get any complains. Installation was prompt. However, the fixture provided for wall mounting did not seem to be sturdy and therefore some additional amount had to be spent for stable mounting. This was done satisfactorily by the same person who came for the installation.",It was a gift,B072QD8QKL

"I was very circumspect while ordering the tv . But it has more than met my expectations. It is very light weight. Couldn't understand the wall mount accessory, however. Sounds ok, too. Best thing is the picture quality. Maybe due to the size. Thinking of getting one more 55 inch . Suggestions to buyers. Wall mount it. As it is very light weight chances of it tumbling over even with a strong gust of wind.",Quality made affordable,B072QD8QKL
"Now that I have been using the TV for about a month, I should say that picture quality is excellent; sound is clear and crisp though total volume level is a bit on the lower side.

"Bought this TV for my parents' bedroom about 3 months back and they are very happy about it. Has good connectivity options, including USB ports to power a fire stick or roku easily and plays media from usb without issues. Personally I find the picture sound quality to be very good for the price and overall value for money. The picture looked very bright and contrast as the upgrade was from a old CRT tv but the inbuilit picture modes were a quick relief. Manually changing settings and overal usage are easy for even elderly. Overall we are very happy with the purchase.",Value for money - decent picture and sound quality,B072QD8QKL

"Worth your every penny. I was searching for tv within 6k budget. After doing a lot of research on the internet and online portal. I finally ordered Kevin. The only con which I felt about this brand is Kevin customer care. When I try to reach their toll-free number for installation IVR always says the same line already our representative is busy. And automated music plays in bg. After several attempts, I tried to open the product and installed by myself as my requirement was not to wall mount. So just want to put the tv in my stand.

"Delivered the first one on 20/jan/19. 1) black dots in display 2) two vertical lines(shadow lines) in display 3) poor sound quality After long calls and inspection by amazon service person replaced the tv. Second tv delivered on 12/feb/19 1) two vertical lines(shadow lines) in display, exactly the same in first tv 2) poor sound quality After long calls inpected by amazon service and given inspection report recommending replacement but this time amazon refused replacement and offered refund. I bought this tv replacing my old 23 inch one, so its a loss for me. So I decide to go on with defective tv. After one months usage with two tv's here is my views 1)Reddishness in display(in both tv) , first it was irritating now getting adjusted. 2) Poor sound quality ( in both tv) 3) display is fixed loosily 4) doesnot support hd channels of my sun direct dth 5) headphone output sound is very low I purchased after reading the reviews by the customer.

Bought this Exactly on eve of Feb ‘19... Product is good for money and I have no reservation in writing this... Sound is quite good and best for bachelors/bachelorette groups.. But keep it wall mounted only cos the BUILT is quite fragilEST sort...even I noticed some different ILLUMINATED patch on the screen with little higher brightness than nearby areas exactly Above the wall mounting bracket.. U may feel the quality is bad at very first days of installation when compared to high end TVs..but it’s quite a performer at this budget range...,Good performer for this BUDGET cost range,B072QD8QKL
"At first, I received defective piece TV which has few dead pixels (stable white dots) but on a complaint, a technician has visited to confirm the issue and then received a replacement piece (as it was just 3 days and Amazon offers 10 days replacement with this product). So far so happy with this experience. It was smooth and painless. TV is very good in it's price. However, comparing this TV with other brands such as Sony or LG doesn't make any sense to me. Color and Sound quality is so far so good. Finally, if you've low budget then this TV is for you.",Worth the money. Great Service & Customer Support,B072QD8QKL

One of the best purchase It has very good quality screen Very sturdy model Trust me u will not complain about this,Best Product,B072QD8QKL
"Top quality TVs (Sony, Samsung, LG) are about 2.5-3 times the price... cheap TV (but reputed names.. like MI, Micromax) are abt 2 times this price - this is so low price (other similar priced TVs were of unknown brands.. Kevin has made some name/presence by now), I was pretty sure it was a cheap quality dud! I thought if this TV lasted the warranty period, then its still value for money,... so i took the risk. TV arrived.. it stopped working on the same day!!!!!! inspection+replacement request registered with amazon.. smooth experience there, finally replaced.. and the new TV works perfectly. Note - the installation+warranty time servicing+repairs etc.. has been outsourced by Kevin to a third party company called Jeeves.. they're all digital, with all communications and visits etc recorded via sms-es, emails, etc... very professional. So, if tv ever gets spoilt, the toll-free experience+service/repair experience should be trouble-free. Also Note - There is an extended warranty provided at the time of purchase - for such a cheap tv, if I had 1 yr of extra warranty, then why not? But fr some reason I could not purchase the extended warranty. But at the time of installation, the Jeeves technician offered me extended warranty from them - so, i bought - 2 yrs for 1100Rs. Am glad I couldn't buy extended warranty at time of checkout.. and since Jeeves is the main entity handling repairs etc, it was better to buy from them... So now my cheap TV has a 1+2=3yr warranty! Nice!!! TV - picture quality - OK.. does the job pretty well, the 15k-20k+Rs TV will be better.. but I don't care, at this price. The non-HD channels have slightly pixellated edges, but I noticed that if I reduced the sharpness to 0, the problem goes away. Everything else is all good - only thing is the ""whites"" seems a bit over-exposed/too bright, and if you reduce the brightness and contrast so that pure white ares of the picture looks alright, then the dark/shadowy/black areas of the picture appear too dark... you have to strike a balance(best settings worked for me at - Brightness-55, Contrast-35, Sharpness-0, Colour/Saturation-35... good balance of reducing overexposed whites and maximising dark-zone clarity), but trust me.. at this price, this is nothing, and you would have a good viewing experience. All other features - eco mode, sound, build quality etc is pretty decent.. no complaints there. Final verdict - Go for it! super low price, pretty good viewing experience.. total value for money.. definitely go for it if your priority is getting max for your money.. if priority is quality, go for samsung, lg etc. Also, I'd suggest - skip the extended warranty and buy the same at installation time from the Jeeves technician - he may not offer it to you on his own, so ask for it.",Mind blowing price and value-for money!,B072QD8QKL
I ordered this as a gift i was really worried how it will be but it was really good with the price range which i got and so happy with the product the only problem i see the picture quality which looking average on normal DTH box probably u need to use HD box but overall it was really good.. I think anyone can buy this without any doubt and the installation was very fast and he was polite and explained everything.. Overall Satisfied,good TV under 10k,B072QD8QKL

"I must tell you that being unable to afford a good TV is no longer an issue if you are going for this Kevin product along with Amazon Fire Stick. Just the TV alone with a cable connection might become boring. I suggest you to buy the fire stick too as it is the most priceless purchase you can do. The TV as such has 1 ""cons"": The 'face' of people you see on TV will appear red and all objects pink or deep orange will also appear red. Why am I still giving it 5 stars: It is ideal for Bedrooms and small halls. The sound system is just okay to satisfy your basic need The fire stick enables it to cast any app and for display mirroring from your phone too! So, therefore if you want to buy the cheapest smart TV but can't afford it, go for this combination as it comes cheaper. Another reason why I chose it was because 32 inch TVs hurt the eye if you're room is small and I also had space constraints as most of the walls either had a bed/cupboard/almirah covering it. I've paid 4999 for the TV and 3199 for the fire stick in the 2019 freedom sale Thanks for the amazing product Kevin, just improve the redness issue and there is nothing to stop this TV from becoming the most sold in this price range where millions who can't afford come.",Paisa Vasool!,B072QD8QKL

Fine for the price you pay. H265 format doesn't read audio. Should be rectified. Reads many blue ray format in pen drive. Audio is huge and sufficient. Will recommend home theater to be connected since all led panels any brand In general cannot take huge volume. Connect with stabilizer for better life. HRDD resolution seems fine compared to my old LG LED TV. Almost 5 months over. Going good. But I'm a rare user. Worth secondary TV. For 5k,Worth the price,B072QD8QKL

Be aware you cannot return this item if you have find it to be poor quality. Amazingly stupid policy by Amazon on it's TVs in general. Much better to buy TVs from a local store. Very bad panel.

Picture Quality and sound both are good. We can prefer this product as this is economically cheap and provide you all features compare to others. But most important is its poor service. They can't able to provide any service. You have to manage it self in warranty also. Even they could not send their representative for installation after 13 days of delivery. But they will call you many times to fix the date and time Teliphonically and forget it.,Good product and poor service,B072QD8QKL

"This TV is completely worthless. I purchase this as an additional TV after reading good reviews and 4.5 rating on Amazon. I can categorise problems in this TV. 1. Panel fitting is not upto mark (Screen seems Loose) 2. Tv Screen bleeds Red Red and RED. (You barely feel any other color) No matter what running on this tv, either you play movie through USB or DTH. 4. No customer care support. Kevin didn't call me for installation, I have to call repeatedly and finally call connected. The person on phone said ""ENGINEER WILL CALL YOU WHEN HE HAS TIME"" till now no one called me. 5. Kevin people don't even provide the Batteries for remote. 6. Wall mount provided with the TV is so weak, I doubt if they hold that TV properly. If Kevin people see this, plz send your engineer and try to solve these problems otherwise I have to return this.",Worthless Product with no installation support and RED bleeding Screen,B072QD8QKL

"Display and Sound r 2 imp aspects of any TV. Putting this review after 5 days of use. This TV has got poor quality display, I m using SD settop box. The closeup image is average view but any distant display is just pathetic. I can see a shape of the display/ image item but cant see the details, like can not recognize the face or eyes etc. Text at bottom of screen while watching news or any channel is pixelated, rough edged text. Even after adjusting display settings,Colors are so bright that r ready to Burn ur eyes. Red is too red, blue is too blue and so on. Overall its a below average viewing experience. Smoothness of displayed objects is completely missing. Sound is loud and Clear, no issues with it. I will not recommend this 32 inch non smart TV just simply coz it lacks very much on viewing, and one need to seriously compromise with his/her viewing experience",Bad experience and below average product,B072QD8QKL

"Have 40"" sony which is 40k 55"" MI which is 45k, Full HD projector around 70k. All these are value for money but this one seems to be more than value that I paid. Wanted to use in room and works as expected, Sound was something I was worried but this easily can provide better sound. Picture clarity to my surprise is good. Havent tried pen drive and other options. Can be really used for smaller rooms and can be a good stand by TV. Worth every rupee.

"TV is no where near a LED Tv resolution; it is at best comparable to a backlit LCD, which I suspect it might actually be! Absolutely horrible picture quality, with pixels showing up in movies and video games. Sound quality is not at all satisfactory either, lots of echo. Worse is that Amazon REFUSED to give refund even though I have reported multiple defects with the TV!

"Bought this TV (32"") on 3rd Jan, 2019 for the price of 8399. Before I begin with the detailed product review I would like to talk about delivery and installation. Amazon, as usuall delivered the product on time with scheduled delivery and product unboxing and verification on spot by the delivery agent. Installation: We need to call kevin customer care for installation request.I read lot of reviews taking about how bad the installation service was but in my case the installation was done on the same day of raising the request (for free). kudos to kevin for that.Kevin has a 3rd party service provider for installation which is Jeeves they are a professional repair n installation company so we can expect professional service from them. Now coming to the TV first things first the picture quality is not bad for the price. Colors are a little saturated but otherwise its quite good. Sound is suffecient for a small to medium room and quality is fine.The Panel is unbelievably light weight but build quality is not too bad but again for the price of course. You can't compare this tv with the likes of Sony, or LG for obvious reasons but for the price of 8k its a fine product indeed. Just go for it... Happy purchasing... :)",Worth Every Penny...!Go For It...,B079ZSFJRG
love it.....awesome sound and superb quality hd channels with hd dish set top box. and the normal channels are also good but sound i must say awesome ....worth budget money purchase,8k@10% discount ....really super tv and better than branded one i saw in physical store,B079ZSFJRG
"I bought it at Rs. 6,550/- from Amazon. Like everybody else, I believed that unless you buy a big Korean or Japanese brand TV, you can't be a 100% certain of it's quality. But on my brother's persuasion, I bought this TV, specifically depending on the reviews on Amazon. The delivery was sooner than promised, and the delivery personnel were very careful and diligent with the delivery. They unpacked the TV to ensure that the product reached me undamaged. The only disappointing aspect was that the Installation team from KEVIN never called. But that turned out to be for the best since I fixed the stand of the TV myself with a screwdriver and then instead of wall-mounting it, I set it up on the TV table. Now let me tell you about the features. Picture Quality is Outright excellent. Compared to similar 24 inch TVs offered by LG, Samsung and Sony, which I observed in stores and my friends' homes, KEVIN has an impeccable picture quality. Color quality is well-managed and the brightness is just right. TV's body is firm and the TV's screen has no wear or ageing despite extreme use for months. The best thing of this TV- the SOUND BAR. You don't need an external sound unit or home theatre system because the SOUND BAR has incredible sound quality which is still clear everywhere, even in a 2000 sq ft house. All in all, don't doubt this TV. Just go for it. You won't get a 24 inch TV with such incredible quality from any other brand for such good price. Let me say that again- ""GO FOR IT!""",Surprisingly Excellent!!!!,B079ZSFJRG
"Nice product...Picture Quality is good. Sound is very nice loud and clear...very light weight... I've also kevin 40"" smart LED....my experience with Kevin is awesome...",Nice Product in this price range,B079ZSFJRG

"Review after using it 2 days: Purchased this TV on Amazon Summer Sale at a price of 6299(with card discount). At such a low price point, this is Incredible. Unable to believe that LED TV's are so cheap right now. For those, who are complaining that the display looks reddish, need to decrease the Saturation level, It'll be fine after that. Play with Brightness, Contrast, saturation and sharpness to get the perfect Image You're looking for. My suggestion is to keep Brightness -45, contrast- 40,saturation-25, sharpness-30. Let me give it's Pros and Cons Pros: 1. Good Packaging. 2. Ultra fast Delivery(Thanks to Amazon) 3. Display looks Great 4. Excellent Audio. 5. Dirt Cheap 6. 2 HDMI and USB ports. 7. Aux/ 5.1 Channel Home theater supported. 8. Installation Done within 24 hours. Cons: 1. Display is not Factory Calibrated, You need to Adjust the display(Brightness/Contrast/Saturation/Sharpness). 2. Remote is not very clicky and Batteries are not provided with remote.(I had to rush to the nearest store for the battery while installing the TV) Manufacturers need to provide that. 3. IR sensor of the remote is weak, You need to point the remote to the TV then it'll work, It does not work in case IR sensor is facing any other direction. 4. Volume is not much effective after 50, There is a Huge different between 30 and 50 but there is minor differences between 50 and 100.(Almost No change between 50-75) 5. CS team of Kevin don't looks professional, they don't even have basics CS Skills. This is a pretty new item and those are my Initial Observations. In case i notice something else, I'll update it here. Hope you found this review a helpful one, Have a nice day!",Good Budget TV,B079ZSFJRG

"A genuine review. This tv is really nice. Picture quality really really good. Bright colours, clear picture, etc Sound is very loud and audio quality is good. 5 types sound adjustments so set as per our needs. At 40 % sound is also very loud. Clear crisp quality. Keep suround sound option off for best results. I feel display is ips i mean made of plactic type which is durable. My child taps hands many times on the tv screen and i feel the screen is durable and strong. As the name says yes the display is led. 2 hdmi 2 usb works perfectly. Tried google chromecast works with an ease. Usb port dectection is fast and easy. Usb data transfer is easy when 2 usb storage device connected . Have tried and worked perfectly. No manual needed. Little common sense and all setup is easy. Side buttons also durable. Tv really light weight. Even a small kid can lift is like a toy. Best part is tv made in india than also i assure the quality of this product is really really worth and good. One can opt to buy the tv without thought.",Wonderful product.,B079ZSFJRG

But Customer service from company side are better than I expected.

1. It's look nice & stylish due to bottom speaker. 2. Sound quality also decent compared to others brand. 3. Picture quality avarage.

I agree the fact that there's no other TV better than this one in this price range. Don't think, go for it.",Great television with nice sound and clarity ...,B079ZSFJRG
"I got this TV at an unbelievable price. This product is definitely worth the money. It might not be comparable to Sony, Samsung not LG but the kind of money they charge is definitely not worth the extra quality they offer. The only complaint is that no one came to install the TV but all necessary pieces to mount the TV on wall are in the box, it took me a total of 20 minutes to mount the TV on my own. If you are looking for a quality product and you are not part of the top 100 richest list then a good buy.",A quality product,B079ZSFJRG
So I am writing this review after using the TV for 3months. The sound of the tv has gone off and I have been calling the customer service of Kevin For last 5days and they have not been able to arrange a technician to check my TV. Really bad. Have put up a complain on consumer forum too as the call centre representatives just keep saying technical issue can't check details or dey keep apologizing for no technician availability....

"Kevin has made definitely a good product. There are 2 32 inch HD tvs available from Kevin on Amazon. One is at 8490 and other is at 9490. Looks to be both are same variants. So if you buy 8490 TV in the same you can get it for 7000-8000 after discounts. 32inch TV under 8000 is really a surprise. I am pleased by the quality of the TV for the price. Pros: very economical, good quality, light weight, sound and picture quality are excellent for the price range. And I received 2 year warranty during the sale. Cons: I don't find any as of now. I received a defective remote, though I had some issues with Amazon, Kevin is very prompt in resolving the issue.

"Its okay for the price paid, I missed buying this repeatedly when the price and exchange offers and card discounts were the best in the first Amazon Festival Sale. Finally bought it for 5490/- under exchange for old 21"" CRT TV. Picture and sound is okay and I bought Sennheiser HD 206 headphones to use with this TV but I find the sound quite low and really have to up the volume in both the set-top box remote and the TV remote. Might be a problem with the Sennheiser headphone though. Have played movies through USB flash drive (MKV/AVI formats) and they play okay. Now am using it mainly for standard definition cable through Hathway set-top box. Made in India so looking forward to good service for supporting national effort.",Made in India,B079ZSFJRG

We at our family were very brand cautious. I purchased TV after reading reviews, specifications on Amazon. I can say the product is superb. I am using it for 15 days now and connected to dish TV. The picture quality, sound was really good. The best I liked is the viewing angle. We at our family can view TV from any angle with the same quality. Thanks Kevin for such a wonderful product. I hope the product will work for at least 2-3 years without any problems. My suggestion is just go for it and purchase. You will never regret your decision.",Superb TV !!,B079ZSFJRG
"The TV was bought just a month back. so far its performance seems to be satisfactory, as I did not get any complains. Installation was prompt.

As it is very light weight chances of it tumbling over even with a strong gust of wind.",Quality made affordable,B079ZSFJRG
"Now that I have been using the TV for about a month, I should say that picture quality is excellent; sound is clear and crisp though total volume level is a bit on the lower side.

"Bought this TV for my parents' bedroom about 3 months back and they are very happy about it. Has good connectivity options, including USB ports to power a fire stick or roku easily and plays media from usb without issues. Personally I find the picture sound quality to be very good for the price and overall value for money. The picture looked very bright and contrast as the upgrade was from a old CRT tv but the inbuilit picture modes were a quick relief. Manually changing settings and overal usage are easy for even elderly. Overall we are very happy with the purchase.",Value for money - decent picture and sound quality,B079ZSFJRG

"Worth your every penny. I was searching for tv within 6k budget. After doing a lot of research on the internet and online portal. I finally ordered Kevin. The only con which I felt about this brand is Kevin customer care. When I try to reach their toll-free number for installation IVR always says the same line already our representative is busy. And automated music plays in bg. After several attempts, I tried to open the product and installed by myself as my requirement was not to wall mount. So just want to put the tv in my stand. Worst customer service. In short, no service provided by Kevin.",Worst customer service.,B079ZSFJRG

"Delivered the first one on 20/jan/19. 1) black dots in display 2) two vertical lines(shadow lines) in display 3) poor sound quality After long calls and inspection by amazon service person replaced the tv. Second tv delivered on 12/feb/19 1) two vertical lines(shadow lines) in display, exactly the same in first tv 2) poor sound quality After long calls inpected by amazon service and given inspection report recommending replacement but this time amazon refused replacement and offered refund. I bought this tv replacing my old 23 inch one, so its a loss for me. So I decide to go on with defective tv. After one months usage with two tv's here is my views 1)Reddishness in display(in both tv) , first it was irritating now getting adjusted. 2) Poor sound quality ( in both tv) 3) display is fixed loosily 4) doesnot support hd channels of my sun direct dth 5) headphone output sound is very low I purchased after reading the reviews by the customer.

Bought this Exactly on eve of Feb ‘19... Product is good for money and I have no reservation in writing this... Sound is quite good and best for bachelors/bachelorette groups.. But keep it wall mounted only cos the BUILT is quite fragilEST sort...even I noticed some different ILLUMINATED patch on the screen with little higher brightness than nearby areas exactly Above the wall mounting bracket.. U may feel the quality is bad at very first days of installation when compared to high end TVs..but it’s quite a performer at this budget range...,Good performer for this BUDGET cost range,B079ZSFJRG
"At first, I received defective piece TV which has few dead pixels (stable white dots) but on a complaint, a technician has visited to confirm the issue and then received a replacement piece (as it was just 3 days and Amazon offers 10 days replacement with this product). So far so happy with this experience. It was smooth and painless. TV is very good in it's price. However, comparing this TV with other brands such as Sony or LG doesn't make any sense to me. Color and Sound quality is so far so good. Finally, if you've low budget then this TV is for you.",Worth the money. Great Service & Customer Support,B079ZSFJRG

I got this for 6800 in sale and I cannot be happier although I bought this as Stop gap product since my old TV broke and I had to buy another on the spot so chose the lowest option due to budget issues but looks likeI I am going to keep it longer. I also purchased Nobil Skido for someone from flipkart last year which costed around 7500 and had Bluetooth connectivity option for audio but picture quality on this one is better the only question is how long will it last. :)",You get more than what you pay for,B079ZSFJRG

"Top quality TVs (Sony, Samsung, LG) are about 2.5-3 times the price... cheap TV (but reputed names.. like MI, Micromax) are abt 2 times this price - this is so low price (other similar priced TVs were of unknown brands.. Kevin has made some name/presence by now), I was pretty sure it was a cheap quality dud! I thought if this TV lasted the warranty period, then its still value for money,... so i took the risk. TV arrived.. it stopped working on the same day!!!!!! inspection+replacement request registered with amazon.. smooth experience there, finally replaced.. and the new TV works perfectly. Note - the installation+warranty time servicing+repairs etc.. has been outsourced by Kevin to a third party company called Jeeves.. they're all digital, with all communications and visits etc recorded via sms-es, emails, etc... very professional. So, if tv ever gets spoilt, the toll-free experience+service/repair experience should be trouble-free. Also Note - There is an extended warranty provided at the time of purchase - for such a cheap tv, if I had 1 yr of extra warranty, then why not? But fr some reason I could not purchase the extended warranty. But at the time of installation, the Jeeves technician offered me extended warranty from them - so, i bought - 2 yrs for 1100Rs. Am glad I couldn't buy extended warranty at time of checkout.. and since Jeeves is the main entity handling repairs etc, it was better to buy from them... So now my cheap TV has a 1+2=3yr warranty! Nice!!! TV - picture quality - OK.. does the job pretty well, the 15k-20k+Rs TV will be better.. but I don't care, at this price. The non-HD channels have slightly pixellated edges, but I noticed that if I reduced the sharpness to 0, the problem goes away. Everything else is all good - only thing is the ""whites"" seems a bit over-exposed/too bright, and if you reduce the brightness and contrast so that pure white ares of the picture looks alright, then the dark/shadowy/black areas of the picture appear too dark... you have to strike a balance(best settings worked for me at - Brightness-55, Contrast-35, Sharpness-0, Colour/Saturation-35... good balance of reducing overexposed whites and maximising dark-zone clarity), but trust me.. at this price, this is nothing, and you would have a good viewing experience. All other features - eco mode, sound, build quality etc is pretty decent.. no complaints there. Final verdict - Go for it! super low price, pretty good viewing experience.. total value for money.. definitely go for it if your priority is getting max for your money.. if priority is quality, go for samsung, lg etc. Also, I'd suggest - skip the extended warranty and buy the same at installation time from the Jeeves technician - he may not offer it to you on his own, so ask for it.",Mind blowing price and value-for money!,B079ZSFJRG
I ordered this as a gift i was really worried how it will be but it was really good with the price range which i got and so happy with the product the only problem i see the picture quality which looking average on normal DTH box probably u need to use HD box but overall it was really good..

"I must tell you that being unable to afford a good TV is no longer an issue if you are going for this Kevin product along with Amazon Fire Stick. Just the TV alone with a cable connection might become boring. I suggest you to buy the fire stick too as it is the most priceless purchase you can do. The TV as such has 1 ""cons"": The 'face' of people you see on TV will appear red and all objects pink or deep orange will also appear red. Why am I still giving it 5 stars: It is ideal for Bedrooms and small halls. The sound system is just okay to satisfy your basic need The fire stick enables it to cast any app and for display mirroring from your phone too! So, therefore if you want to buy the cheapest smart TV but can't afford it, go for this combination as it comes cheaper. Another reason why I chose it was because 32 inch TVs hurt the eye if you're room is small and I also had space constraints as most of the walls either had a bed/cupboard/almirah covering it. I've paid 4999 for the TV and 3199 for the fire stick in the 2019 freedom sale Thanks for the amazing product Kevin, just improve the redness issue and there is nothing to stop this TV from becoming the most sold in this price range where millions who can't afford come.",Paisa Vasool!,B079ZSFJRG

Trust me Kevin is selling on lesser prices then prices are available in wholesale market like Lajpat Rai market, Karol Bagh Market and Panchkuian Road Market in Delhi. I bought 3 tvs from Adsun. 2 are repaired by them three times but still are out of order but still in warranty. The Adsun is not doing the needful. I wrote to Adsun as well as to Amazon but there is no response from any side. Now only option is to sue Amazon as well as Adsun.

Great TV at this price. But there could be a little more improvement in both display panel and sound bass. A very small part of the panel (at left down corner) looks more brighten then rest part of display. But its not a big problem. I'm keeping this in my home. Hope it'll last for years. :-) Thanks Kevin and Amazon.,Best secondary TV. Could take 1000₹ more to add screen mirroring option.,B079ZSFJRG

"Cheap product..Cheap quality..buy at your own risk Defective product received. Screen had a black dot at the bottom of the screen a hardware fault which was confirmed by the install guy and later Amazon service guy. Amazon will not give you a refund if the product is defective and will force you to get the TV replaced. Didn't want to get a replacement as lost faith in the brand the first time, but Amazon forced replacement You have to call the brand..the brand will NOT call you..you will have to persistently call the brand for installation as their phone does not work always..seems that the brand is not interested in after sales service too hope that one year warranty will be provided and they will attend to calls. Please buy the TV at your own risk. If you can better spend some more money and go for a reputed brand and not this. Still did not want to go for a replacement but Amazon is forcing for a replacement and not issuing a refund. Amazon services have to gone bad they just say that you are a valuable customer and then tell you that they are sorry and cannot help, which will help them lose more customers. Again read all critical reviews before buying this Brand which are cheap Chinese assembled TVs with crappy panels. Would have been happy if Amazon had given me a refund but now NOT happy with Amazon.

"This TV is completely worthless. I purchase this as an additional TV after reading good reviews and 4.5 rating on Amazon. I can categorise problems in this TV. 1. Panel fitting is not upto mark (Screen seems Loose) 2. Tv Screen bleeds Red Red and RED. (You barely feel any other color) No matter what running on this tv, either you play movie through USB or DTH. 4. No customer care support. Kevin didn't call me for installation, I have to call repeatedly and finally call connected. The person on phone said ""ENGINEER WILL CALL YOU WHEN HE HAS TIME"" till now no one called me. 5. Kevin people don't even provide the Batteries for remote. 6. Wall mount provided with the TV is so weak, I doubt if they hold that TV properly. If Kevin people see this, plz send your engineer and try to solve these problems otherwise I have to return this.",Worthless Product with no installation support and RED bleeding Screen,B079ZSFJRG

"Display and Sound r 2 imp aspects of any TV. Putting this review after 5 days of use. This TV has got poor quality display, I m using SD settop box. The closeup image is average view but any distant display is just pathetic. I can see a shape of the display/ image item but cant see the details, like can not recognize the face or eyes etc. Text at bottom of screen while watching news or any channel is pixelated, rough edged text. Even after adjusting display settings,Colors are so bright that r ready to Burn ur eyes. Red is too red, blue is too blue and so on. Overall its a below average viewing experience. Smoothness of displayed objects is completely missing. Sound is loud and Clear, no issues with it. I will not recommend this 32 inch non smart TV just simply coz it lacks very much on viewing, and one need to seriously compromise with his/her viewing experience",Bad experience and below average product,B079ZSFJRG

"It's good tv, I suggest to buy it. if your bad luck knocks your tv and if you get any problem. the TCL India show you the worst experience you have ever seen. I have faced a problem black spot on the screen and raised a ticket on Sep 17th, 2017. Hyderabad TCL support team reached my home and take few snaps and said like there is panel problem and they are going to replace it. Ticket Number: 5269501 After few days I called to know my status support number 1800 419 0622 and they said we are looking into it. Again after few days on 5th Oct called to same support number and asked about the status of the ticket. Not even solving the problem they closed the ticket. Spoke with Support team lead and finally, after few days they reopened my ticket.then I realized that they need to order the panel from China. Every day I need to call the support and need to ask like "" Baba what is my ticket status"" 😶 After many follow ups I got an update like it's delivered to Hyderabad. Now the New Legend comes into my issue his Name is ""FEDEX"" . Oct 21 my packet is delivered to Hyderabad and today 7th Nov and still they are delivering that packet to TCL India( Hyderabad Branch) You guys need to follow up your docket number because it's not TCL part follow up the docket number where the packet is. If you want problems in happy and cool going life .. go and BUY the TCL TV",Very Bad Support Team,B07DTSCMMB

"I would highly recommend that no one should purchase this product. I received this tv on 1st march. It just worked for 15 days. Since then i have been calling tcl customer service, speaking to all the team leaders, and finally i got to the head of the technical department Mr. Balwant. Its been 4 months since then that ive been following up on this matter. He assured me that thr amount will be refunded, took my account details n kept telling me for 2 months that the amount has been transferred to my account. I knew there was something fishy. So i called up the call center again to check. They informed me that the refund was never sanctioned by the higher authorities. So on questioning Mr. Balwant, he puts me through some person called jeetender to claims to be the head of balwant, he promised me a call back after looking into the matter. On calling him several times he says the transfer of he amount has been cancelled bcos of gst. Isnt it funny? I called him up again he said he wasnt in office n again promised a call back which never happened. N evrytime i call him he disconnects my call. So people please think 1000 times before purchasing this product. Its been 4 monyhs n im still struggling to even talk to the right person in tcl. Right from the call center level to the managerial level....all r just fooling their customers.",Most pathetic product as well as service,B07DTSCMMB

"Seller: Cloudtail India Private Limited Price: 10990 (Plus 10% discount & 1000 cashback = 8900/-) Delivery: 2 days, Prime, Chennai Package: Well packed, safe arrival Installation: Free with Basic wall mount, 2 to 3 days time Recommended: No, unless you have service nearby so you can knock the doors Alternatives: Sanyo 80 cm (32 inches) XT-32S7000H Returnable: Yes, only if defective or damaged Update after 6 months: Surprisingly No issues till now, sound quality is poor. But still i can't recommend this product for you!. Update: NO trouble as of 3 months of regular usage!. Glad that I have crossed 3 months. Will update after 6 months! Product Review: ~~~~~~~~~~~ If at all Amazon hadn't given this for such a low price of less than 9000/- I wouldn't have purchased it, reason being too many poor rating for it's after sale service. Though the add-on pack for free installation couldn't be added to Chennai location, still I had the option of choosing the free installation at the check out menu. Luckily TCL service is nearby my locality in Chennai, hoping I don't have to run around. Actual Cost : 12990/- Deal price : 10990/- Discounts: 10% with 1000 cashback as Amazon Pay Box contents: ~~~~~~~~~~ TV Unit x 1 Table Stand set x 1 Remote x 1 Warranty card & User manual x 1 Wall Mount: ~~~~~~~~ ♠ No call back, I had to request repeatedly for installation. ♠ Have to register with them through calling their customer care for warranty ♠ Call and confirm the installation. ♠ Basic wall mount would be provided free of cost with installation. --Took 2 days to complete the installation Some highlights ~~~~~~~~~~~~ ◘ Little over thin bezels, look great ◘ Ports: VGA, HDMI (2), USB (2), Component IN, Audio IN (DVD/PC), SPDIF, Antenna IN, Audio out (Amplifiers) ◘ 2 speakers in built in TV, decent if not great for voice ◘ Audio out port gives good clarity of sound when played musics (TV pre-amp is good) ◘ Graphic spectrum for music player is just for showpiece and don't expect any ◘ Plays MKV, MP3, avi, MP4, but 1080p is little overload for this TV ◘ Picture quality is decent (for a 720p) for a 10K price and no complaints ◘ For warranty claim (Note, slip is not sealed or attested) Amazon invoice bill is mandatory and you need to call them ◘ PC using 720p (1280) resolution at 32inch may not be pleasing ! Picture quality is decent for its asking price and I have no complaints. Color reproduction is precise and sharp for a 720p panel. Plus, you wouldn't expect more from a 720p as the telecast from set top boxes doesn't exceed beyond 720p resolution, it is a proper balance. Final words: ~~~~~~~~ I may not recommend this product though it has served well for me, as a matter of fact after sales service is very important and this TV seriously lacks. It is only the pricing and cashback that lures the customers and I did fall for that. At slightly less than 9000, this TV is not a big hole in my pocket if it repairs and all I expect is 1 to 2 years time to work. If you still would like to, then make sure you have access to TCL Service in your town nearby and if you get special offers below 9K which can help you come out of vex later. Hope it helps If this review is of any helpful, consider making it more helpful for others.","At 9K, this is not making a hole in my wallet but without a proper service this is not for you !",B07DTSCMMB

"After doing a few research on the best Televisions of 32 inch and under 15 thousands, finally I have purchased this TV. Yesterday, the TV has been delivered at home and the initial impressions are good. I got Rs. 1000 discount and don't wait so long for the discount until there is a great Indian festival season. This has got maximum Rs. 1000 discount so far. In some season there might be some chances to get discounts on the Bank cards, if you have those card you would get maximum Rs. 2000 discount. Now, will tell you about the TV Unit. The weight and size is well managed. Sound output is enough and not great and low. It fulfils your basic to mid-range requirements. I cannot say that this is a great TV, becuase I have not tested of used other TVs in the category. Though, saying that this is a best TV, will not be fair. If, you are in hurry to buy a TV and ask me for my opinion, I will say buy it. Anyway, I will post some more details about the in-depth tech-specs or the performance later. There are some reviews on the YouTube, and those are useful. Thanks,",A good LED TV,B07DTSCMMB

"Bought it on 28th June & delivered by 2nd july in Jaipur. Best budget Tv in this range as compared to other brands..I searched many brands in this range ( below 15k) and finally ordered TCL from Amazon after seeing so many positive reviews by customers. Prons- Best brand in this price range Build quality is very good Sound Quality is also good Video Quality is superb Looking like a top brand Cons- Only one thing bothered me is demo & installation by TCL. I called the tcl customer care first day when I got it on 2nd july17, but after so many nobody came for installation. Finally on 15th July I saprately purchased wall mount from local market and fixed it on wall by a local machenic. Which cost me around 500 rupees.",Best budget Tv below 15K,B07DTSCMMB
The product is good. Its certainly worth its money. The service from tcl is pathetic. Its almost 10 days since i bought it and even now the installatio is not done. The customer care will tell that it will be done today only but it never happened. The local customer care(bangalore) they will never pick your call or they keep their phone switched off.,Good product but horrible service,B07DTSCMMB

"Purchased on jan 20th, Writing review after 3Months, 100%Satisfied with the product, No issues found for the last 3Months usage (6-8Hours Daily usage) Sound,picture everything is fine, not fantastic! Got this at an amount of 9900(Including cashback) The only one drwback is, it lacks 3.5mm audio jack out, so we can not use a headset directly, but its not an issue, bcaause nobody wants to use headset with tv, for using home theatre we can use R+L cables for connecting which will come with most of the home theatres. If you can connect hd settop box for local cable and opt for hd pack, tlc, nat geo channels are awsome to watch on this.",Wonderful for this price.,B07DTSCMMB

"I use this with an Android 7.1 TV Box and a Windows 10 mini PC through the two HDMI ports. I do not use this with a cable TV connection. Display is excellent . Both the Windows 10 mini PC and the Android 7.1 TV box recognise this as a 1080p native resolution display. But, this TV is marketed as a 720p device....Why ? IDK. The different shades of white , off-white, grey, dark grey , black etc etc can be distinguished well. You can observe this when using the color calibration images. The TV also has Standard, Dynamic, Mild and User modes. The backlight , contrast, etc settings are automatic for all modes except User mode. Youtube , Netflix , Prime Video ( both Android and Windows versions ) look excellent in 1080p resolution on this TV . Display is good when browsing the Net too. I availed of the exchange offer , and this 1080p 32 "" TV cost me INR 11K. Since I have paired this TV with an Android 7.1 TV Box ( costing INR 3.6K ) , I now have 1080p 32"" Smart Android 7.1 TV for a total cost of rupees 14.5 K. The HDMI ports are placed very conveniently to the side . Make sure to use type A HDMI cables with SLIM heads . HDMI cables with fat plugs ( heads ) cannot be plugged in . I have not used the VGA or USB ports or cable TV connection ports. Windows users FYI: Ensure that under Graphic properties , the Resolution is set to 1080p and ,most importantly , the frequency is set to 60p Hz. Use the TV remote and set picture mode as "" Panorama"". The picture will fit perfectly . I have not used this for high end gaming or as a normal cable TV .","Excellent display unit with 1080p, good color reproduction , and with different picture modes",B07DTSCMMB
"Excellent TV. Been using for a month or so. The speakers are of great quality, picture quality is nice as well. Only issue is the installation. It took about a week with multiple follow up calls with customer care.","Great product, installation takes time",B07DTSCMMB
"One of the coolest LED's for this price, serves the purpose, and has free installation. The brand is a sub brand of India (In India). So quality is good. It's light weight and power efficient too. The only downside is its screen being a bit soft, if you put your finger on it, you can see the prints left there for few seconds even after your removal, but who puts there finger on the TV screen?",Best buy for the price!,B07DTSCMMB
"The set is working fine, I feel its a good purchase at this price. The installation team came the second day after I called them. The equipment to hang it on wall is also with them so you need to contact them for it. they were quite responsive and gave a good demo and told me to contact them in case of any problem operating the set. Only one thing not good it that the remote is a bit less powerful than other brands like samsung etc. as you have to keep it in straight alignment with the set to operate.","The set is working fine, I feel its a good purchase at this ...",B07DTSCMMB
"great product for the price. Have been using it for at least 8 hours a day for the past 1 month. Set up was straight forward. The wall mount appointment went without any hiccups.

"Purchased for my parents.. we fully satisfied with this TV.. purchase it without any doubt. But one thing to notice is, we need to use DTH set up box for good picture clarity (in normal cable we can see dots). Sound is also good (we can't expect like in branded one, but not bad). I got it for 9,950rs in lighting deal, thank you Amazon.",Buy it without any doubt.. but use DTH for good picture clarity,B07DTSCMMB
"Excellent product compared to the price,I don't find any difference between Samsung or LG with this product, Most of my relatives are using the very similar specifications product @18000 Plus-Rupees, Why? But I bought a very good LED television & saved reasonable amount of money also. I must appreciate the picture clarity & sound clarity of the product, Simply awesome for the money I paid. The only concern is product & service quality, I hope nothing will happen at least for another 2-3 years period. Thanks to Amazon & TCL.",Excellent Product For The Money,B07DTSCMMB
Television is working just fine... I found that a authorised service center is present in my city so I am happy about future repairs....,Working Nicely,B07DTSCMMB
"i would highly recommend that one should purchase this product. I received this tv on 1st march. It just for 15 days. Since then i have been calling tcl customer service, speaking to all the team leaders, and finally i got to the head of the technical department Mr. Balwant. Its been 4 months since then that ive been following up on this matter. He assured me that thr amount will be refunded, took my account details n kept telling me for 2 months that the amount has been transferred to my account. I knew there was something fishy. So i called up the call center again to check. They informed me that the refund was never sanctioned by the higher authorities. So on questioning Mr. Balwant, he puts me through some person called jeetender to claims to be the head of balwant, he promised me a call back after looking into the matter. On calling him several times he says the transfer of he amount has been cancelled bcos of gst. Isnt it funny? I called him up again he said he wasnt in office n again promised a call back which never happened. N evrytime i call him he disconnects my call. So people please think 1000 times before purchasing this product. Its been 4 monyhs n im still struggling to even talk to the right person in tcl. Right from the call center level to the managerial level....all r just fooling their customers this. must not happen tcl big looser",cheated me,B07DTSCMMB

"I bought is as second tv at my home for purposes so that kids can watch for around 30 min in a day. And it is perfect fit for such job. You should not buy this as your first tv at your home as experience with tv is that you get what you pay for. I bought it around 6 months back and picture quality wise it is very normal. One can easily spot differences in picture quality of this tv and brands like samsung. Now coming to problems thatbi am facing with this tv: First of all it doesn't have any switches on tv to turn on, off, adjust volume etc. as result of which you always rely on remote. One can argue that on tv switches are seldom required but once you don't have them you realize it's importance. Anyhow second and stupid issue I have faced is that tv isn't turning on now. To my surprise when I called up service centre in working hours I have been told that service centres are closed for next 5 days on account of Holi..ahh...I can't believe this. Service centre being closed due to a festival for 5 days...that's why I said you get what you pay for. I am pretty sure this wouldn't be case with Samsung, Sony or any d3cwnt branded tv.

"PROS: It's been around 50 days since I bought this TV and it is working absolutely fine. Quality product in the cheapest price, it cost me only Rs. 9,990 (11,490 - 1,500 (HDFC CC cash back)). Great picture quality for HD channels and HD videos, SD channels are also look fine if we connect with HDMI port. Sound is good, no need to buy additional 2.1 or 5.1 speakers. Quality of plastic material used to build this TV is strong and tough. Fast CC service in Delhi, I got my wall mount installed in only 24 hrs. Supports most of the video formats. CONS: Small dark shades are appearing on all four corners of the TV, I called up CC for this, they told me that ""it appears default in their all TVs and no need to worry about it"". However they sent their guy to my home to reconfirm if there is any other problem. I got only 18 months of manufacturer warranty and no options available to extend this, even if we pay for it. (Planning to buy 2 years of third party warranty from Amazon, it will cost Rs. 1,500). Bass effect is not available in sound, it's in-built speakers generates unpleasant sound if we increases the volume to full. TCL field executives don't have enough knowledge of their products. TCL does not even has their customer support in India they depend on third party vendors for this. To view the unboxing, please search on YouTube: TCL L32D2900 UNBOXING.",Quality Product in the Cheapest Price (Detailed Review),B07DTSCMMB

"Good TV at this price, however it further got reduced. All basic features are there but dont expect highly advanced settings. Have been using for 6 months. Quality is excellent but you will know this only if you have HD channels. Slim design TV and good remote. Sound is also great again but you need to have a good HD channel. Good option if your tight on budget or want a second TV. Technician came (standard fixed wall mount is free) and fitted but charged double the amount for customised wall mount. Fit flexible moving wallmount, worth 500 extra bucks as u can tilt the tv however u want and easy to clean back of tv and connect the cables. HD wire is given free with TV.",Good TV great price for HD channels.,B07DTSCMMB

"** Initial Impressions ** ● The box had the TV, desktop stands & screws, warranty card and user manual ● The bezel is very thin and is glossy black which gives a premium look to the TV from the front. The power cord is built into the TV that cannot be unplugged ● There is a low profile TCL logo at the bottom center of the bezel. There are navigation buttons hidden below the logo incase the remote control does not work. The remote is quite handy and has a glossy black finish ● There is a Connectivity Bay that faces back that houses these ports - VGA female port to connect computers - Component Video In phono plugs to connect DVD video - Left & Right Audio In phono plugs to connect DVD audio or computer audio - SPDIF ● The bay that can be accessed from left houes these ports - Two USB ports - Two HDMI ports to connect HD set top box or Blu Ray player - Coaxial Antenna In to connect Cable TV or TV areal antenna - Audio Out left & right phono plugs to connect to external speakers ** Installation & Warranty ** ● I got a call from TCL requesting TV installation on the day of delivery, but was before delivery. I could not reach them on phone once the TV was delivered to me. After two days, I called TCL customercare and raised a request. After waiting for three days, I self-installed the TV and then I was contacted by the technician! ● Amazon told me its okay to self-install the TV, but need to get in touch with the local TCL service center to get the warranty registered. But, my local Service Center told me its not required and the Amazon bill is enough to claim warranty. Quite confusing and misinformed! But finally, I was told to send the bill and serial no over Whatsapp to the technician ● Installation involved only the fixing of desktop stand which can be done if you have a star-screwdriver. But if you plan to wall-mount the TV, TCL technician will bring in the free wall-stand ** Usage & Performance ** ● The TV turns on with a TCL animation which I did not like really. I disabled this from the Options menu ● Clicking Menu button on remote opens a tile with options like TV, Multimedia, Source, Options, etc. The different sources are TV, AV, VGA, HDMI1, HDMI2 and Component Video - TV is for analog channels that goes through the inbuilt TV tuner. If you have a rooftop areal connected, you can watch Doordarsan - When VGA is selected, the TV will pick up video from VGA port and audio from Audio In phono plugs - You can connect set top box to HDMI port ● The multimedia tile will take you to features to play video, music, photos, etc. I tested videos in mkv, avi, wmv and mp4 and all worked well. I played music files in mp3 formats only ● The subtitles in English are displyed for USB movies, but not any other Indian languages ● When turned on from Standby, the TV opens into the last input source you were in. If there is no signal from the selected source, the TV switches through all sources and stops at the first available signal ** Display & Sound ** ● The display has got good brightness, richness & clarity and I dont have anything to complian about it. But if you sit too close in the order of 3 or 4 feets, 720p screen is sure to show up the pixels. But beyond that distance, you can't spot a difference between this display and a full HD display of the same size ● I played a 1080p mkv movie from USB and every 20 or 25 seconds, there was a quick freezing of screen which was not there for videos in other formats ● I have connected Sundirect HD DTH and it is a pleasure to watch the channels. Standard Definition videos in 4:3 format gets stretched to fill the screen in 16:9 ratio ● I am very much impressed with the sound reproduction. I watched Avatar from USB and the preset Movie mode produced good bass effects which I really liked. There are two down-firing speakers which works really well ** I don't like these ** ● While music is played, there is a nice graph visualisation displayed on the screen, but that is just a dummy and is very ugly as well ● There should have been an option to turn the TV screen off while music is being played from USB ● The remote has got a Return button that is supposed to take us back to the previous menu item, which does not work infact ● The click quality of the remote is also not upto the mark, but the click feeling is really good. For some functions to work, I have click more than once ● There is a white light below the TCL logo that turns on when the TV is on Standby. I dont like this which is very bright and looks very ugly for me at night ● There is no way to browse through all the contents in a connected USB. If music is selected, only music files are displayed and the same for videos and photos. I prefer seeing all the contents of a connected device ** Summary ** ● I had earlier purchased a 55 inch 4K TCL and is satisfied with that; it gave me the confidence to go for this one ● I am quite happy with the input options, video & audio quality and USB playback. I paid Rs.13,490 in May-17 and I rate FOUR stars. One star off on all those things that I dont like.",Good TV with all what I need for the price,B07DTSCMMB

"Hello People. I'm writing this review with very sad mood. Totally disappointed with this tv. Disappointed because of.. Video picture quality is below average, sound is pathetic, as it goes totally down n up automatically. While playing FHD videos, this tv lags every 3rd or 4th second. TCL service is too bad. Called more than 6 times than they came for installation, at the time of installation I was not present as I was at work, the installation guy fooled my mom by selling a dth 3 pin for ₹400 as he said that your previous dth 3 pin will not work on this tv, you have to own this, so my mon paid him ₹400 for a 3 pin audio video cable. Amazon charged me ₹50 for delivery and delivered me before the given date. Sound and video of USB files are too bad. So guys, think 10 times before you purchase this television. Better to go with SANYO 32"" LED tv. You can get at 12999 in offer and at 13499 without offer. My friend have the SANYO tv and the clearity and sound is very good. I purchased my this TCL tv for 13499 with no cost EMI. But I can only cry, no other option.

"I got this model through reliance digital for less than 13k. Service was excellent by them it was not by TCL guys. Nxt day delivered and installed on same day. In this page it has mentioned 18months warranty but actually when I got it from store it is 3yrs warranty and everything done by reliance digital which is certainly very good. There might be some difference in serial numbers (I’m not sure). Now comes to picture quality, never compare with Sony, Samsung and Panasonic those are different level brands. Try comparing with Mi tv, VU. In this comparison, I can say TCL is better than Mi. Though Mi has smart and 1000rs higher picture quality is not up to TCL. Even sound output is far better than 2 other competitors. End of the day its your comfortablity to choose better one. My friends suggested me Mi Tv but I have gone with TCL because I found it more convincing than other 2. It has wall mounts too in the box but in amazon reviews they mentioned no wall mounts. So please ensure everything and buy this product. Thank you",Worth for less than 13k range TVs,B07DTSCMMB

"Ordered my TV on 11.08.2016 and was delivered on 17.08.2016. Fixing the stand was a bit tricky but not that difficult. Picture clarity is awesome. Sound is awesome once you do the wall installation. Easy to connect your USB flash drive or Hard disk. Picture are not being displayed. Only videos are playing. Does not have an AUX port but has sound output slot. So if you want to connect external speakers then you have to use an RCA male to AUX converter. Registered for wall mount installation on 17.08.2016 late night and was done on 21.08.2016. 18.08.2016 being holiday, the promised timelines of 72 WORKING HOURS was adhered to. On the whole, TV is worth the money spent. This is definitely a better option than other TV brands like Micromax, Sanyo, and others in this price range keeping in view the proven brand record of TCL in countries like US.

"I would highly recommend that no one should purchase this product. I received this tv on 1st march. It just worked for 15 days. Since then i have been calling tcl customer service, speaking to all the team leaders, and finally i got to the head of the technical department Mr. Balwant. Its been 4 months since then that ive been following up on this matter. He assured me that thr amount will be refunded, took my account details n kept telling me for 2 months that the amount has been transferred to my account. I knew there was something fishy. So i called up the call center again to check. They informed me that the refund was never sanctioned by the higher authorities. So on questioning Mr. Balwant, he puts me through some person called jeetender to claims to be the head of balwant, he promised me a call back after looking into the matter. On calling him several times he says the transfer of he amount has been cancelled bcos of gst. Isnt it funny? I called him up again he said he wasnt in office n again promised a call back which never happened. N evrytime i call him he disconnects my call. So people please think 1000 times before purchasing this product. Its been 4 monyhs n im still struggling to even talk to the right person in tcl.

"Ok at the budget range, 1) Sound quality not that good. Not sure how did they compare the sound quality with other. 2) delayed start up, on power on. 3) Service is worst, Even after appointment had to call external guy, pay Rs 350 odd. After few days the guy turns up ask all the details of the product & shipment. (Got an impression that he wanted to inform his higher authority about he has done the installation). 4) Thought American, but Chinese :( . product. If you are not looking for service, then would suggest this TV as an OK option at this budget. Else it will be nightmare with fake promises.","ok TV, Worst service.",B07DTSCMMB

"Everything about the product is very good and worth given the competitive pricing. In my opinion only two things are lacking in this product but i think you get what you pay. 1) Viewing angle is no that great, the screen has a lot of gamma and color fades when viewing from sideways. But when we are at center or not that far sideways from center there is no issue. Again given what i am paying for, i think this is the best TV in the price section and nothing too critical to complain about. 2) Instead of placing the video output along with the YPbPr ports they could have provided an extra video out port separately. The things i liked about this monitor 1) 32 inch 720p : ideal for the SD DTH and HD ready DTH services. For best picture quality get HD DTH service 2) 2 USB ports, plays most of the video formats MKV, MP4 etc 3) 2 HDMI ports 4) Slim design and narrow border panel",Everything about the product is very good and worth given the competitive pricing,B07DTSCMMB

"(Update )It's been 4.5 months since I purchased this TV. Its running smoothly and there are no problems. Even the SD channels are very clear at an acceptable viewing distance. I recommend to couple it with airtel DTH (since it gives best picture quality). The sound output is amazing. The bass is clear unlike other led/lcd TVs which sound like they are kept in a box. This is a really good product. Good value for money. Both video and sound outputs (Dolby digital) are excellent unlike other low priced led TV's. Perfect for medium sized hall. The only problem is with the customer care. If they miss to send technicians on the decided day, they will take another 2-3 days to come and install the TV. I would really recommend this TV .",Amazing TV at a budget price.,B07DTSCMMB

For a 32 inch TV to be at around the 12k price range does usually mean there might be some major trade off. Fortunately the TCL L32D2900 is fairly stable a product a works pretty well.

POSTPURCHASE: 1. LOOK wise very nice, 2. plays all most all video formats. 3. remote is easily accessible for old age people. 4.u can also connect mobile as usb storage . 5.picture clarity is very fine, i hope it is DLED. 6.VERY LOW WEIGHT. 7.play malayalam premam 720p movie , u can easily understand the clarity of tv. 8.installation done with in 2 working days.free wall mount and installation. 9.

"So i just go this TV and first impression is really good. TV is good looking and well built. Packaging was also nice and decent(not too much flashy and tacky. There is no wall mount(i didn't need one i have big table) provided. The stand legs are easy to attach and sturdy. I fitted the TV and used my external HD to play movie Gravity. The picture quality is really good for this price and the sound is surprisingly good. You can hear the slight booms used in Gravity movie differently(like somebody is moving table on your upper floor). Loved it. Overall i am satisfied and happy. When you press USB button on remote, it takes you to default photo show. Press menu 2 times and choose video show to play videos in USB mode. Took a while to figure out.",Audio 8/10. Picture 9/10.

"Honest review about TCL as TV is best amoung all budget led TV in the market. Picture quality and sound quality comparable with my previous lg LCD TV. Accessing media with pen drive is easy. I will give 4 star for TV assuming it's durability is good. Now come to service part. TCL customer care listen to your problem but I think they are helpless as they have given service to third party called RELIANCE. I have ordered TV on 10 Aug. And was delivered on 14 the of August. Till date I am in contact with TCL customer care. Requested thrice for wall mount and finally RELIANCE engineer arrived on 23rd Aug. He said TCL not provide wall mount for your TV. You have to purchase it. I told him that TCL assured me that installation is free. He charged me rs700 for stand and installation. (P.s.As TCL and RELIANCE came to know about the matter, they have taken quick and strong action, within few hours service engineer refunded the amount taken for stand and installation as he was unaware of the installation term. Mr. Jignesh from TCL assured me about no further inconvenience from there side. Mr. Sahil from reliance also assured for further co-operation in any problem in service part. Thanks to both of them to resolve the matter.) I am happy with the product and the service. Now I m giving 5 star to TCL. All the best.",Product and service both are good.,B07DTSCMMB

"I bought a samsung 55 inch TV, 55F8000 series on March, 2014, May. And it's not even 3 years completed. I started seeing, Green and Red lines on the left side of the display. The service engineer came, seen the issue and he said the Complete Display Panel Needs to be replaced and it's going to cost 66,000 indian rupees !!!!. The service engineer, told, it happens in some TV's, during long run, due to heating issues, the bus may get short and hence lines appear. It was Very shocking to hear this, that too from a branded TV like samsung. I called up samsung customer care and they said, the warranty was over in 1year and they can't do anything. IT""S VERY BAD THAT A BRANDED COMPANY LIKE SAMSUNG, USING POOR QUALITY PARTS, WHICH CAN""T EVEN SUSTAIN FOR 3 YEARS, AND THEY CHARGE PREMIUM TO THEIR CUSTOMERS. Others Beware, before investing huge in their TV's. Personally, i don't suggest. The Tv costed more than 2 lakhs in Indian Market and in the end this is the kind of quality we get.

"Here Are Some Pro's And Con's Must Read Before Spending 15,000... Pro's: -1. First is undoubtedly the size of the display at which you getting for the given price tag. It is a 32 inch TV, in centimeters that would be 81.28. 2. Talking more about the display it comes with a resolution of 1366×768 pixels. Technically it is a HD ready panel. Right now it is impossible to get more than an HD ready screen. Because that will dramatically increase the price or you will have to compromise the screen size. The refresh rate is of 60 Hertz which is same for all budget TV. 3. The viewing angles is also quite decent with 178 degrees. That’s 8 degrees more than most other TV. The colors, brightness and saturation does have no any changes if you are watching within that viewing angles. Viewing Angles in Degrees4. Another advantages is that it comes with 2 HDMI port for connectivity. Normally all budget panels come with a single HDMI port. Connectivity and Ports5. The same goes with the USB port, it comes with two of them. It is actually hard to find one with 2 USB ports. Con's :- 1. The primary problems or issues is with the power consumption. It requires 45 watt while the panel is on display. 2. Next cons or disadvantages is that only two ready-made modes are available viz. cinema mode and sports mode. 3. If you are thinking to mount on the wall without leaving any space on the backside, well then its not possible. The reason is the because it requires a lot of space due to the 18 cm thickness. It just gonna look like the TV is hovering in space.",Best Tv Under 15K...Budget Led Tv?..,B07DTSCMMB

"When my 10 years old Samsung LCD started giving problem for last 2 months, was looking out for a non-smart branded TV (For branded I mean - LG, Sony, Samsung and Panasonic). And this one fits perfectly. This is good for 1. Available space or requirement is only 43 inch, so 4K/UHD does not make sense in this size. Full HD it is. 2. Smart features not required as you prefer to use media hub/player like nvidia shield tv, fire tv stick, AVR setup etc 3. Need a branded TV with proper service network 4. Don't want to spend much, as TV viewing is minimal but need a TV for living room's decor 5. You need both brand and budget 6. Prefer to wall mount Do not buy this when 1. You need ARC (audio return channel) as you don't have media hub or AVR 2. You need a smart TV as you do not have a media player 3. You want to use HDMI link/CEC 4. Need super image quality like 4k, HDR etc 5. You need 120hz panal (this is 60hz) 6. You do not want to wall mount and prefer table top. Now, overall a good tv with decent picture quality, no light bleeding or any other issues - whole screen is evenly lit. Has 3 HDMIs and a USB. USB gives only .5A power so you cannot power your chromecast/fire tv stick from it. Supports playing movies and songs from usb. Menu/Settings give minimum options to tweak. Misses out ARC and CEC. Sound is as usual like other TVs. If you want to watch movies invest at least on a decent sound bar. Really value for money; when on offer/cashback/discount if you buy this and spend on a Amazon Fire Tv stick, it saves minimum 5k~7k from a cheapest branded smart TV. Comes with basic wall mount inside box. Thin bezel, looks good on wall. Highly recommended.","Best 43inch non-smart LED TV available across brands, Value for money, good looks, wall mount inside",B07F1SKCZ2

READ MY REVIEW OR BLOW YOUR MONEY,B07F1SKCZ2
I found a defective product (there is a blue line across the screen) and the picture quality is not acceptable. Doesn’t produce or effectively render the HD quality; may whatever HD settings you choose! This product didn’t come with a TV stand but came only with wall mount equipment set. Would recommend not to buy this product.,Product no good,B07F1SKCZ2
no Extra Option . sound is poor . quality is too poor . Waste Money,Waste of money,B07F1SKCZ2
"I bought this TV for 21k after discounts for using SBI card ,exchange and great Indian sale .at that price this TV is a must buy.it comes only with wall mount as expected.",Satisfied,B07F1SKCZ2
I think this is good tv but picture quality is very poor and voice is very low and never buy Samsung product.,Bad experience,B07F1SKCZ2
"Great TV for this price range n size. I got this TV for 25990 with 2 consecutive discounts on the sale day. It's not a smart TV but who cares, just plug a Amazon fire TV stick if u demand for one. The picture quality is great, same as the Sony TV I own. Sound is on the lower side, u may opt for an external speaker to enhance that. Got the TV wall mounted by the Samsung guys within 48hrs of delivery as promised. If u want a good brand good TV under 30k,this is it",Great TV,B07F1SKCZ2

"PLease don't fall into this marketing gimmick. Its not HD TV, its just 720p which is not Full HD and you will NOT be able to have HD experience. Its so shame, companies making people fool by writing HD ready: ""Resolution: HD Ready (1366x768p)"" Whereas the resolution is: 1366x768p not 1080p, Read the above statement carefully, it's written in description and its a way to make people fool. Actual the ""HD"" word means: 1080p and less than this is not HD, less then 1080p is just partial HD and if you get this TV and watch it with any DTH HD: you will not be able to watch good crisp HD picture, nor it will give any good experience with Amazon Fire TV stick and Netflix. Ultimately any TV which says: Resolution: HD Ready (1366x768p) is trash so stay away from it!",It's NOT HD - Do not Buy it,B07F1SKCZ2
The picture quality is awesome but the sound quality is worst.,Worth buying,B07F1SKCZ2

"Amazon delivery service is the worst ever in this world. I ordered this TV ,delivery boys came with the TV and took it back , because their card reader machine was not working how disheartened. Whole family was waiting for TV and delivery boys were so illeletrate that don't how to start card reader machine and connect even the account they were using to log in was of different person. TV ka sapno tod diya amazon walo ne. Now we have decided to delete amazon prime account.",Amazon delivery service is the worst.,B07F1SKCZ2
The picture quality is good. But connectivity options are poor. It doesn't have an HDMI arc to connect high definition audio players or speakers. It's an outdated version.,Very less connectivity options,B07F1SKCZ2
"Listed at ₹34k as I write this review, good deal to consider the specs and screen size of 43 inches. Bought it from local Samsung dealer costing me around ₹2.5k more than today's offer here. However got Samsung 2.1 speakers bundled with it as part of Independence day offer. It is non-smart TV with 3 HDMI and 1 USB & VGA port. Only point to consider is the sound output which is only 14 W, which can be easily enhanced using any home theatre or speakers you may have.",Good Deal within 43 inch screen size,B07F1SKCZ2

Great picture quality at an amazing price! Had wanted to wall mount and that's what I got! Else every TV comes with a stand which is wasted and keeps lying in the box! Helped save money for additional item (table stand) which is generally not utilized! Similar model in retail store is Rs. 4K more!,Simply Amazing!,B07F1SKCZ2
Picture quality is awesome. It plays almost all format videos from USB. The only drawback is sound. Even at full volume it does not meet the need. You definitely need an external speakers.,Sound Quality is poor.,B07F1SKCZ2

Very bad product the pannel has been cracked from inside. I have warrenty but company deny to give warranty. They are not ready to agree it is automatic according to htem it is physical damage though there is no sign of damage on outer surface of the screen.

Micromax has fooled the customers with the misleading description. I'm not able to access the Prime video and Netflix from this TV as the google play store in the TV does not show NETFLIX while you search. Also when reached out to the service center they now say that Netflix won't work in the TV. And buying this TV is of no use since it does not perform the functions mentioned in the description. Absolutely unsatisfied with the product and the service. Wasted Money on it now that I have to buy fire stick separately.,Misleading information and description,B07GBDVNVJ
Micromax is so bad that even 1 star is more for us. Even though if they sell in 1000 dont buy as this will wastage of money. Service is so pathetic. Raise a issue and you won’t hear them.

"Here's a perfect example of you get what you pay for. Smart only in name, this TV manages to do the bare minimum to call itself that. It comes with Netflix and YouTube. All the rest of the apps are useless to put it mildly. Youtube freezes the TV every 20 minutes requiring a restart. You will need an external speaker to actually hear anything worthwhile from the TV. Overall, I am disappointed. Primarily because my expectations were so low to begin with, it actually took work to make me feel worse about the spend. The TV managed.

"Writing this review after nearly 6 months of usage. Was it worth it as a TV? Yea. Totally! But as a smart TV? Not at all.

Be it screen share, network connectivity, audio played over android phone, everything with connectivity is very bad. But if people are ready to see past the shortcomings, it's a good TV.

I have subscribed for HD channels. So picture quality has greatly improved than what was earlier. Regarding 'Smart Features', once connected with mobile hotspot, we can play YouTube.

The package was received on time - but the details shared on the website are not correct. I have been trying to call number shared for Installation for about 30 - 40 times (5 Hr.). When I got through I was told that the serial number is required whereas the website does say to share the serial number. It says only to share the order number.

"It's simply the best smart TV based on Android. Its very easy to use, remote is ergonomically designed, has few buttons with voice command built into it. Screen is fabulous and crisp, does justice to 1080p content on YouTube or hd on Netflix. One thing which is not par is sound quality. Primary sounds/ vocals are loud and clear but secondary backgrounds are lacking, you have to increase the volume but that reduce the over all experience. I recommend a separate Bluetooth/aux speaker with it for cinematic experience.",A great smart TV for it's price point.,B07GTD1LHY
I purchased this for my retired parents as a replacement for their 5+ year old Lyod LCD nd after using it for first time I believe the old TV was much better. I have a another Micromax led tv as well which is 10x better picture quality. I had convinced them that TVs are standard and can be bought online without any issues. But for the first time I accept their view. NEVER BUY A TV ONLINE. I Assumed this is a certified android TV from worlds acclaimed 2nd largest selling brand but the TV is horrible. The picture is soo rich in Color we have not switched it on after the first attempt. The picture even HD is grainy and dull. No amount of settings helped with improving it. Called up Amazom for return and they reminded me that I haven't gone thru their policy and TVs can be only returned after an inspection report. WHAT ARE THEIR TECHNCIIANS GOING TO INSPECT? OR RATHER WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO COMPARE WITH ? PLEASE AVOID THIS BRAND OR BUYING TV ONLINE.,Horrible picture quality.,B07GTD1LHY
Absolutely loved the price and the features. Picture quality is good and so are the smart features.,Awesome purchase,B07GTD1LHY

"Worked perfect for a month. The issues started with freezing every now and then, automatically turning off, bluetooth not working. Worst sound quality. You will need a pair of speakers to understand even the simple words. Bluetooth doesn't have the option to disconnect or reconnect with the paired devices. You will have to unpair and pair everytime. Now about chromecast: It will take atleast an hour to connect. In last 3 months I have been able to connect just once. The signals are weak and unstable. Customer service: Everytime you call the toll free it will land on sales team, they will arrange a follow up from the tech team, and that follow up call never came. Tried to contact amazon about the same issue, didnt help either. Conclusion: It looks fancy and cost effective but its a scrap. DO NOT BUY.",1 month USE only,B07GTD1LHY
So far so good.... Used the item for approx 1 month so satisfied with TCL smart tv.. so ordered one more for my frnd as gift. But only conc. is TCL service team they never respond. I expect this to be installed in 24 hrs but it took almost 3rd day it was get installed at my place.(NOIDA). Sport from that product is so good.TCL has to improve CX service quality.,Product awesome but service average.need improvement.,B07GTD1LHY
"Smart volume doesn't work. Voice search is not working. Try to complaint to TCL, they are very smart to handle the customer. They won't attend customer call keep says its busy. if we went to fill a complaint online their application mandatory field ""Date Purchased"" wont allow to fill the date and can not complaint. Finally we cant complaint either through call or web. Nice tricks. Also amazon just throws the ball to the customer face saying contact TCL customer care. TCL is worst in customer service.",TCL is worst in customer service,B07GTD1LHY
"Pleasantly surprised with the whole experience and the product, first time I've ordered a somewhat large appliance, took a while to have it delivered but I guess with the Amazon sale it would have taken that little extra time. Package arrived with no visible damages to the box, setup was done a couple of days later after contacting the company. TV works great but the sound could be a little better.",Great deal,B07GTD1LHY

"I am using this TV since 2 months from now, I do not see any problem. The picture quality and sound quality is really good. Some times the TV responds bit slowly when we are switching from one app to the other app. I feel that the lag is not that a big problem. Cast option and its connectivity is very fast and happens quickly. Usb ports also has a quick response with respect to pendrive or external HDD.",Value for Money,B07GTD1LHY
"At first TV was working fine, after 3-4 days it got started hanging. Google Assistant was not working. Unable to install Amazon prime and other stuff.

Please don't go with this TV",TV is hanging too badlyy,B07GTD1LHY

"I use this TV for internet purposes. First of all its takes too long to start since beginning and now when I press the menu button it now again takes lot of time. It is barely after 1 week of use. The product is too slow. As far as voice recognition is concerned, you have to sit near to the television otherwise it won't work. So I strongly recommend not to use this product.",Puneet Bansal,B07GTD1LHY

Putting this after 10 days of regular use. Had a tough time finding a good TV. Ordered IFALCON from Flipkart but they cheated by sending different model. Then I decided never to buy from Flipkart and IFALCON product. Found a budget deal for LED 43 inch in Amazon in terms of TCL. Second day delivery the same guys did wall mount. Amazing experience. Superb HD quality Details are great Easy to use No problem in connectivity so far Beautiful remote Volume is sufficient Little disappointed with the sound quality... Not much details and bass..... Sports mode is great though... They can improve .. But better than MI at least... Go for it at a price of 23k with 18 months warranty.. trust worthy brand,Nice deal... Satisfied.,B07GTD1LHY

No fake review.. Since it is electronic things so maybe the response will be vary but I had purchased it during Great Diwali sale and having 10% cashback with 10% HDFC discount. As usual the Amazon delivery is on time as scheduled. The greatest achievement is on same day within 6 hrs it has been installed even though it was Sunday. Such fast action I never expected.. really awesome. Now see how the TV works in future but until now it working well and it is beyond Value for Money. Thanks Amazon and Thanks Sanyo/Panasonic.,Excellent LED TV in this price.,B07H7WPV7D
"This TV is brilliant value for money, you get 720p, IPS Panel, LED, 16 watts sound, good viewing angles (for my use it’s perfect), picture quality and colours are good and the installation request and suppprt is being handled by Panasonic so that’s good too. I bought this TV recently and for moderate everyday use this is fine, but if you want gaming experience and use it as a HD monitor I don’t think you’d be happy better buy a full HD tv. Good work Sanyo 👍👍👍",Brilliant VFM Product,B07H7WPV7D

I have 43 inches Full HD earlier purchased two months back and considering its performance I had ordered it on 7th DEC 18, not surprising to me, this is a good TV and response is brilliant.

"Purchased this TV on 12th Oct 2018 to replace a 5 years old LG LCD TV. It was installed immediately after receiving the product in good shape. The picture quality is not vibrant like those in Samsung or Sony. Similarly, sound quality is also average and not enough to make an impact. The USB menu settings are very primitive. Unfortunately, within 1.5 months of use the TV has developed a fault that the speakers stop working after 15mins -1 hrs. No amount of fiddling with the settings will bring back the sound. You have to switch it off for 1 hrs to get the speakers working again. Have emailed Sanyo helpline today and is waiting for them to come and investigate.!",Faulty within just 1.5 months.,B07H7WPV7D

"I am writing this review after using this TV for the past 2 months. Over all I should say that I am fairly satisfied with the Product considering the money that I paid for it. I use it extensively with Amazon Firestick in HD mode which gives a very decent picture from viewing distance of around 5 feet. Pros: - Low Price - Audio only Mode to switch of video and save power when using Amazon Music - Neat looking TV - No heating even if it's run for whole day continuously - Decent Audio quality Cons: - Very old fashioned remote - Power rating is not 3 stars. This TV takes 65 Watts while similar size of other costlier brands take 50 Watts power. - Not sure if refresh rate could be better.. I see some not so smooth movement of images when watching sports especially. - White looks very bright. So in low backlit setting the White still is prominent. Conclusion: I got this on discount sale for effective price of 9000 /-. Haven't had any problems that would necessitate a call to Service Station.. given that Panasonic Service is supporting this, I must say that it's worth a buy.",Value for Money,B07H7WPV7D
"The TV is fine. I already have a Sanyo TV in the main hall and I wanted to have a smaller one in the bedroom, so I bought this. The problem was with the installation. I wanted a corner mount, and I told that to the lady who called to set up the installation. She told that it costs 2,500/-, I told her was very costly for a TV that costs 10,000/-. I asked her to send specifications of the mount, which she said she would not do. Also, they don’t keep any in stock and if I wanted one, I would have to book it, without them telling me anything else about it. She was also rude enough to bang the phone when I asked questions about the mount and booked just a normal installation request. She did however tell me that this was a Panasonic brand wall mount before banging the phone. I had to speak with the technician who was kind enough to say that he can come the next day with a corner mount. What I got however is a local mount, which is not able to hold the TV straight, and I have been advised not to move much else the TV would tilt to a side after some time. The mount initially pointed the TV towards the floor. To fix that, the technician made some ad hoc washers and now the TV keeps tilting to the left all the time. The TV is good, but I may not be able to enjoy it much as I guess no one would like watching a tilted TV.",Good Tv. Costly and not so good installation.,B07H7WPV7D

"Model number Sanyo 24S7000F. This is high resolution led bulb not a Led TV, amazon refused to return this Led TV. So think twice before ordering this TV. Features and function are good, sound is also good but picture quality is very bad. there is missing of HDR technology, so you cannot adjust white balance, it affects all over screen. My great mistake to choose this full HD led TV from amazon. Pros : 1. It's a full HD led TV under Rs-6300 2. It's manufactured by Panasonic. 3. Excellent sound clarity. 4. Provide music mode, so you can listen music without turning on the display. 5. It's smart remote control comes with media player buttons. Cons:- 1. Narrow viewing angle 60 degree,more than 60 colour faded and negative picture . 2. Not proper balance of white, no HDR, sometimes white colour affects all over screen like over exposed Picture and also white portion more white and dark portion more dark, like cheap Chinese TV. 3. Wrost colour reproduction. Overall I can give 2 🌟 out of 5 🌟 considering resolution and other features. If you want better picture You can go LG or Panasonic IPS LED TV for better pictures, Don't impress it's full HD feature",Picture Quality very very poor,B07H7WPV7D
"Reasonably satisfied with the performance of this TV though I feel most TVs at this price range would be near about similar in features and performance. So nothing exceptional about the brand or this TV. The sound quality isn't great. Picture quality is good but not sharp. The response time is poor as there's a noticeable gap between command and execution using the remote. The installation was swift within 48 hours. It comes with the wall mount. The remote looks and feels primitive but does its job. In case a different brand is available with better sound even at a slightly higher price, I would recommend that. But overall this TV seems to be a safe bet and value for money",Good without being anything exceptional,B07H7WPV7D

"The screen suddenly developed a black patch which is increasing ever since. There has been no response in changing it or repairing it from the customer service, Sanyo.

"Review written after 2 days of 4 hrs usage each Model: 24 inch FHD Environment: Moderately lit room without sunrays. Panel type: Not A+/Achromatic, has a reddish tint, found while colour calibration on Windows. Switching technology: IPS or VA.. couldn't verify, wide angle of view is there, can't measure response time Settings: Backlight set low for less eye strain Sharpness set low to avoid grainy image quality Contrast set low Colour and brightness set medium Noise filter set High Pros: Very thin bezel, good picture quality after tweaking settings. USB supports FAT as well as upto 2TB NTFS Hard drive, 1080p@60Hz supported over VGA, Speakers are good Cons: Probably specific to my unit, but Audio Out has a slight buzzing noise, independent of TV volume (Solution: Set Speaker volume low, TV volume high), TV back gets warm after prolonged use, PC audio in is a bit noisy, Unable to adjust tilt (obviously), Only h264 video codec supported, h265 is not supported on usb, very few audio codecs supported. Advice: Spend some time with the colour calibration. It's better if you have MI remote because the provided remote buttons will get worn if used repetitively.

"A very good product, the clarity is really good HD quality, I chose it because it's from Sanyo, I'd recommend it to anyone, I actually brought it for my laptop so I don't have to stare at a small screen, I've connect my laptop thru VGA cable and the quality is awesome but the VGA cable is an expensive one, ive connect tv speaker 3.5mm Jack from the laptop- sound quality is also awesome, till now I've had good experience, it's been 4 months. But remember one thing, when you get the product, you have to check all the available ports, you'll never know which port is not working.","Good tv go for it, branded stuff.",B07H7WPV7D

"Till now the TV performs very well in regards of picture as well as sound quality Firstly, discussing about the picture quality. It is good to see at SD channels and very good quality at HD channels. I think preset colour modes are not so much effective except in vivid mode, otherwise you can adjust manually colour settings by your own choice on User mode. Noise reduction should be High mode & dynamic contrust should be in Off mode as it reduces the brightness. Colour temperature should be adjusted to normal or warm mode, because in cool mode it's looking some bluish look on display which is seems to be un-natural colour tone for me. Presently, in my possession one Sony Bravia TV, which is more than twice the price than my Sanyo tv (which is only Rs. 13,490/-). When compairing the both I don't feel so much difference between the two in regarding picture quality. Obviously Sony is better undoubtedly. When you watch white color it seems pure white in Sony. I am using Videocon d2h HD set top box which looks great on the both tv. But when compared in sound quality I observe Sony is far better than Sanyo, I think Sony is the best of all. In Sanyo, some preset sound modes are provided which is average in quality, it may be improved by User mode by adjusting the bass to 90-95 & treble in 60-65. In surround mode, the sound becomes down-graded & lower. I am placing it on table top, so it will be better to Off the surround mode in my opinion. Remote control is simple, looking cheap but effective. After initial adjustment it will not require always if you are using set top box. Regarding connectivity, it has 2 HDMI 2 USB port which works flawlessly when connected to an one TB hard disk but remember, it could not support the all type of audio & video format, 2 composite video-in but there was no component video-in port provided, I think it is not so useful as HDMI port produces a better quality of audio- video & also very compact (only one cable needs as for components 5 cable needed) Conclusion: After an intensive research regarding brand value, real world experience, product reviews, features, weight (4.4Kg), after sell service and above all the price, I found it is the best in class under 15K segment. So go for it if you are planning to buy a low budget Tv with great specifications......",Great Product at an affordable price....,B07H7WPV7D
"Sanyo India is going good with products like these. The tv is good,720p panel will lasts for 30,000 hours(will see, official website claims,use everyday for appx 10 hours and the panel will last for 8 years). Audio is not good,works alright,the sound from speakers is loud but not clear. Usb works fine(mp4 video format works,but official website doesn't lists this format as supported). Hd stb works via hdmi port and is working fine. Writing this review after a month's usage,one star less due to not-so-good audio quality. Hope family TV lasts for claimed 30,000 hours!",Good product at a reasonable price.,B07H7WPV7D
Good as for now.. excellent display considering the price point..but external headphone jack is creating a hissing sound when connected to external speakers.overall satisfied... warranty extended to 1+1 years...,Good value for money..!!,B07H7WPV7D
->Awesome TV in budget. ->Picture clarity and sound is so far very good as I have been using it for almost 1 month no complaints till now. ->I would definitely recommend for people who want to buy TV in budget that to 32 inches then this one is the best according to me.,Simply Awesome,B07H7WPV7D
Bang on for the Buck. Smooth delivery. Good packing .Hassle free Installation. It took like 4 days from order to installation. Performance is good and sits pretty cute on my wall. For it's size and quality I feel there should not be any reason to spend more on a costly product offering the same 32 inch Led product. Sanyo /Panasonic seem to have given a good product in the economy zone bracket. ..keep it up,Bang on for the Buck,B07H7WPV7D

"Got this item. MADE IN INDIA is written on the back. And I decided to give 5 stars. People who ignored this item have missed an opportunity to taste a desert item at the cost of VADA PAV. I am such a smart to purchase this thing at Rs. 12449/-. New addition: Today its 2nd Nov 19. My TV set has gone for repair and it is costing me Rs.4000 + lots of headache. Initially I was thinking I bought a good product. But motherboard caused problem exactly after two years and now I am getting it replaced with new one. And its cost is around Rs.4000. I am not sure weather its a bad luck for me or the quality is actually poor. Remote stopped responding after one year. I had to replace the same. Speakers are not good at all. Poor sound quality. I am sad. Because I bought this only to avoid Chinese products. But a kind of repent. Not because I am thinking I should have gone for the Chinese available but I should have gone for something like Sony or LG or known product to our market. If I face problem again, I will send this product back to amazon or may be Panasonic.",gone for repair and it is costing me Rs.4000,B07H7WPV7D

The TV was installed within 3 hours after I have received the same and the engineer to was very polite. The price is also reasonable. Warranty is for 2 years but I request Sanyo to increase the same for atleast 5 years. Overall a very good product.",Sanyo 32 inch LED TV.,B07H7WPV7D
"ITS SUPER VALUE FOR MONEY! I've specially ordered this by checking the reviews. I seen other expensive ones but was curious if this could beat them as I was on tight budget. Was doubtful at first but after a week.. it has got nothing to disappoint me. The sound was awesome. You don't need to buy separate woofers for this. Amazing bass as well. Picture quality.. build quality.. awesome. If you compare with other expensive ones.. there could be some differences maybe but who cares... you won't even notice it(I tried). Blindly go for it guys. It's brand is also trusted. Sanyo if from Panasonic which is a well known brand highly reputed for their multimedia display manufacturing including phone screen, camera screens etc. PS: Please vote up this review as it helps me come up with more unbiased reviews for whichever products I buy and use. Thanks.",STEAL DEAL FOR BUCKS!,B07H7WPV7D
This is nice television for this price. Yes there are some limitations in terms of motion blur even though having 60 hz frequency. Sound is just OK. Working with Amazon fire TV stick and serves all requirements.,Good TV at reasonable cost.,B07H7WPV7D
"I got it for 10K after applying all offers during deal. Its been more than a month now and TV is working absolutely fine. It is as per my requirements and exactly what they have mentioned in the description. Talking about this product, Sound is loud and clear, It has great viewing angles and picture is clear. It was nicely packed and was delivered on time, only problem was in the installation. I did it my self and nobody came for installation. They just kept calling and took appointments but eventually nobody showed up :( One should pay attention to following things before buying a television. However you can get detailed info about the same on amazon.in as well under TV category but theses are important ones: 1) There is a difference between HD Ready, HD/Full HD LED and Smart TV. One should buy according to their needs and budget off course. 2) One should buy TV according to their room size to get effective outcome from a TV. ""Bada hai to ... behtar hai"" won't work in every home. 3) Go for premium brands, so that going further you get proper service/warrant/guarantee.",One of the best TV in this price range,B07H7WPV7D

"Awesome and crystal clear picture quality in hd movies and sound also good in this budget.. I have watching from above one year, have not faced any problem yet.sanyo is a part of PANASONIC.

"TV desrves 5 star.Very light weight with narrow bezel and attractive look. But someone has bluffed in the old review stating that it is 3 star energy rated but it is not.It is 2 star energy rated. Installation and demo is hassle free from Sanyo. However after few days when I change the picture quality from Standard mode to cinema/vivid mode and change other settings like brightness,contrast ,and sharpness by default it is resetting to USER mode. When contacted via mail to their customer support no reply.Further contacted via Live chat no respnse,they just sayHello, May I help You!.Finally when contacted customer care via voice call.hoping that they could guide me in setting the picture quality they disappointed me telling that they have raised a complaint request and technician will call within 24hrs.

"This was the cheapest 32"" I could find from a brand I had heard about. I don't trust the Chinese brands and Indian brands are typically Chinese ones rebranded. The Korean ones demand a premium. Sanyo is a Japanese brand and I have numerous appliances and gadgets in my home that are Japanese and have lasted decades (yes, decades!). The build quality is good, assembly and mounting are simple. The picture quality is not the sharpest if you are looking from a couple of feet. At 6 ft or more the picture quality is acceptable. The TV is not slim but you get what you pay for. It is certainly lightweight though.","Value for money. I already got a 32"" and when need a 42"" or more I'll again look for a Sanyo.",B07H7WPV7D
"A great buy indeed. Real value fr money. Bought it a month back, the picture and colour quality s great, sound s average, acceptable considering the price. I have paired it up with my Home theatre, it s working fabulously. Thank You Update on 27/10/17:. The panel in my TV is displaying vertical n horizontal lines. Called up Sanyo Service Centre yesterday n hv registered the complaint. Followed up at least 3-4 times, complaint no: R261017832179. Still waiting for a technician to arrive and check. Team Sanyo admin: please help me out. Update on 24/05/18: Just after 14 months, the display of my TV went off. When I consulted Sanyo service Centre they sent a technician promptly. He mentioned the TV's picture panel has developed a snag and it is not repairable, it's life is over. He checked with his office and found out that a new display panel costs INR 16000(pls note the tv buying price was 13500, isn't is extremely odd??? Also if a LED TV panel's life finishes in only one year I really have doubts on the quality of Sanyo TVs.

"I bought this TV in Sep 2017 and it stopped working last month (Dec 2018). I chose this brand over other cheaper options as its a sister brand of Panasonic and the perceived superior Japanese quality. However, the TV stopped working after 15 months and the service centre guys quote an amount of Rs 6,000 to repair as the warranty was only for 1-year. Please do not buy this product unless you get longer warranty. Repairing costs are prohibitive and really makes you wonder if it makes sense to buy a TV at 50% price which lasts only 15 months than paying 100% for a TV that will last at least 5 years. Truly disappointing..",Whats the use of buying cheap product if it does not last,B07H7WPV7D

"Hello readers, Its been over a month since I bought this TV, installation was done free of cost within 48hrs.... Sanyo is just a brand recall, the product is manufactured by Panasonic and is made in India. Ideally this product is fit for the first time buyer or people switching over from CRT set to a flat panel (all are welcome), excellent pricing, sturdy build, sound quality is decent, color reproduction is good in terms of depth and screen coverage, the TV menu & remote operation are user friendly. This product include the pedestal, wall mount, remote unit, AAA batteries and few screws. My overall experience 4/5 stars in other words satisfactory. Thanks for reading...","Sanyo 80 32inches, Recommended",B07H7WPV7D
"This is the best experience I have had in buying an LED TV. Sanyo was independent Japanese company but is now a subsidiary of Panasonic, Japan. So you get a product designed and manufactured by one of the oldest and best electronics companies in the world. Thanks to Amazon who has made purchasing electronics so much easier in India. From online purchasing experience to product delivery and after sales service, Amazon provides complete satisfaction. PROS ---------- 1. Comes with free wall mount kit. Although it looks cheapest possible kit, but it is strong and it works fine. 2. Installation is free and quick. I made call to Sanyo as soon as TV was delivered and the installation guy came in next 2 hours. 3. A+ grade panel. Gives a really pleasing TV experience if you have TV connection with HD quality subscription. 4. 2 HDMI and 2 USB ports. Not many TV in this price range give you so many ports. 5. After buying Sanyo TV, Amazon sends you discount codes for Airtel and DishTV DTH connections. So if you are planning to switch to any of them, you can save money. Minor Issues ------------------- 1. Comes with only 2 cables - power cable and video out cable. There is no RCA cable that is used to connect set-top box to TV. Samsung TV comes with RCA and HDMI cables. But you can use any old cables. 2. USB ports are near the back-center of the TV to the left. After mounting the TV, it is very hard to reach there for a right-handed person. You can either use a better quality wall mount kit or attach a USB extension cable.",Very Good Experience,B07H7WPV7D

Sanyo is is a famous Japanese company. Now its acquired by Panasonic. So don't worry about warranty and sercice. It is handled by Panasonic in India. Panasonic service is great. I got these information from a Panasonic technician who came to my house to install my Panasonic tv.,Sanyo is a good japanese company. don't worry about warranty and service,B07H7WPV7D
"A true value for money product. Picture quality is good. We use it primarily through casting and screen mirroring. Sometimes there are hazy pictures and a lag between the two. But overall it's good. You can expect amazing performance at this price. Sound is good for a 13 by 14 room, maybe not bigger than that. Too early to comment on durability but hoping it would at least work flawlessly for 3 years",Value for money product with decent picture and sound quality,B07H7WPV7D

"This TV is of inferior quality , it's motherboard has developed snags in just 1 month and the company is not able to resolve it yet. I would request anyone looking at buying this TV to be cautious . I am having a pretty bad experience chasing Panasonic to fix my Santo TV. I have heard all sort of silly reasons of this faulty TV not working from the technician and strongly believe this is substandard .",Avoid purchasing this faulty TV,B07H7WPV7D
"For the price it's very good. After sales service is provided by Panasonic, which is a plus point. Panel has a little blueish tint and contrast is bit off. Sound is below average. Hooked up my PS4 with this and performance was okay okay. Update: After using it for 18 months TV panel multiple develops dark patches and clouding issues. Not a long lasting panel.",Cheap TV for Cheap price,B07H7WPV7D
It's been more than 2 months since I purchased this product. Amazing product as per the price .

A sincere thanks to Amazon for making life easier for us. And brilliant job by Cloudtail to deliver really fast. Product is good. Very much the way I wanted. Some audio formats not supported though. No sound in some blue ray movies. Else everything perfect,Thanks Amazon,B07H7WPV7D
The TV has a lot of what is known as dirty screen effect. There are these dirty patches and vertical banding on the TV which become prominent when watching something dark. This is very distracting and if it's a problem with all Sanyo tvs then they must do something about it or if it's only a problem with the particular set I received then I am seeking a replacement . Another problem that I found was that the USB player stretches out the image to fit the whole screen even if the movie is in cinemascope and there is nothing you can do by adjusting the aspect ratio. Only you can zoom out but then that's like watching the movie in a 25 inch TV. Again they should provide some firmware update to sort thing out.,Dirty vertical bands and patches under the screen (awful dirty screen effect),B07H7WPV7D
"Hello Friends, Led is really fantastic, Nice colour quality, Best Sound, Light weight, Good viewing angles and in the package you got a wall mount, remote and some cables.

"Don't know what the product is like as Sanyo had advised that somebody will be there in 24 hours to install the same, which unfortunately hasnt. Very bad Customer Service and it will probably reflect in quality of product as well.",Bad Service By Sanyo,B07H7WPV7D
"The picture quality is good as well as the sound especially at this price. Most of the formats works well when trying to play from external device except if the file has some special codecs. After 2 months, one fine day I could see shadows at the left side as well as the upper and the lower sides of the TV screen.Then I lodged a complaint with Sanyo. It seems that the service here in Kolkata is taken care by Panasonic. The technician examined and came to the conclusion that the panel is faulty.He took some snaps and later me asked me to send him some snaps seeing which can be convincing that the fault is really there. Now I am awaiting for further action from Sanyo and i was informed it might take more than 15 days. So that's the scenario with these LED tvs, i guess the old CRT were the best. On 23 Oct, the part was finally replaced with a new panel and we are all happy.Thanks Sanyo!",The picture quality is good as well as the sound especially at this price,B07H7WPV7D
I'm happy about the overall performance of this TV. Fully satisfied with the display and features built in. Although it is 720p but I've no problem in playing even 1080p and that too looked good. Audio is great. It's a great product with that price range. Thank You Amazon.,I'm happy about the overall performance of this TV,B07H7WPV7D
Worst product I have ordered from Amazon. Screen is detached from the panel. I tried to replace this item but option is not coming on app as well site.

"Got more than expected! Sanyo is not a very well known brand but the quality it produces is awesome. Actually Sanyo had been fully taken over by Panasonic in 2011 and since then these TVs are manufactured by Panasonic in their sub-brand name- Sanyo. In case there is any need for service, it too will be done by the Panasonic technicians. So one can trust this brand. And last but not the least, It's Japan, NOT China.",awesome quality! really satisfied.,B07H7WPV7D

"ok for the price, picture quality is not that great, refresh rate was showing as 50hz, inspite of the product description saying 60hz. you would see the effect when watching fast movement scenes, you feel like looking away from screen. Not a great TV, but as the top brand TV's are more expensive, and you are ok to compromize on picture quality one can go for it. Better buy it in store, where you can see and compare.

Installation service was very bad. There were just 3 nuts/bolts to be screwed behind the led in wall mount stand but sanyo ( panasonic) service man just fix only two nuts and did not screw third one. I am sure..TV will fall down very soon...as quality of stand is too weak plus service man so lazy that he choose to screw only 2 nuts out of 3. I want to ask sanyo/amazon who will be responsible if my led falls due to weak wallount stand and poor installation?? Overall led seems ok..but Color and sound is not at all matchable to we have in other brands..there is a huge difference....but again at this price ....it is acceptable..if we want to spend less money..then don't expect supreme quality.,Quality of installation service compromised,B07H7WPV7D

I would have given this a 4 star but the sanyo customer care has made me very irritated. The requeat for instalation was raised by me on 11th august but even after 13th august has passed no one from snyo called or talked to us regarding installation, it was only when on 14th august i had to be a tad bit rude with them did they pay any heed to the request.

Now when I went to wall mount the unit I discovered that 3 of the 4 wall mount screw holes namely M1, M2, M3 & M4 on the back panel are jammed. It looks sealed with a broken screw (See the attached picture). This is pathetic and I can't put it on the wall now.

"There are implicit advantages of buying TV offline over online. You are always sure shot that TV will work flawless the first time you turn it on at home, since you checked it before buying at showroom. But this is not the case with online buying. I bought this Sanyo led TV in prime sale from Amazon. When I turned it on, a horizontal green color line appeared at the center of screen. The unit was defective. I called up the Amazon customer care, and was told that to return the TV, it first needs to be inspected by the Sanyo technician. I raised the issue with Sanyo customer care over helpline and was promised that technician will visit in the next 24 hours. But no one visited! So, I called up the customer care again to inquire the status and I was told that the complaint has been closed at their end. This is surprising that the complaint can be closed without resolution. It’s been 6 days already since the purchase date and amazon return deadline expires in 10 days.

Called the Service Centre and they came next day. They fixed the set on wall, tested the set and did everything. I am extremely happy with both the performance and Panasonic service. Cheers. One thing i must say, as per product Design is concerned, the Access of USB and other ports are very difficult to access if the set is mounted on the wall. Sanyo/ Panasonic must think about it, because due to space problem more and more customer will prefer to fix the set on the wall instead of keeping it on a table occupying a good amount of valuable space.",Sanyo 81 cm (32 inches) XT-32S7000H HD ready,B07H7WPV7D

"Sanyo is a Japanese brand working as subsidiary of Panasonic. Pros: 1. Good hd quality, you wont find any difference between 32 inch hd and full hd panels. 2. 2 usb ports (that means you can connect your chromecast in one usb and its power chord in another usb) 3. cool led light below panel 4. It has every major feature you will find in other major brands like lg, samsung or sony Cons: 1. It supports only mp4 format 2. panel built is cheap 3. Stand in made if plastic not at all durable 4. it cannot play larger than 2 gb movie files Conclusion: Apart from minor cons, this model has excellent picture quality.

"Hi All, I bought the TV after seeing so many good reviews about the Good Service. In my cards I had Sanyo, VU and Micromax TVs as options to pick. VU TV: Even through many positive reviews, I didn't go for it because my place is little interior and I could not reach the support team at all through phone calls. Micromax TV: Irrespective of many service centers, many negative reviews regarding services. TCL : I never heard of this brand, so I didn't research through. I ultimately decided to purchase Sanyo TV, but had a horrible experience regarding their Service Center & Installation person behavior. I had given them call to install. They sent a young guy in two days. Then we realized the screws were missing from the packing. Installation guy said it is very difficult to get screws in the open market, you have no other way to buy them in open market and he left urgently without installing. Then we realized that he looted away 2 x Rs 500/- notes from my home which we kept on sofa. We bought the screws in next day nearby shop and called for installation again. That guy refused to come and another middle aged man came over and installed it. I complained about this incident to Sanyo customer care, local service center everybody. Case ID # C130217008994. But no action taken at all. So my advice is, if at all you decided to purchase the TV, ""BE VERY CAUTIOUS ON THE PERSON VISITING YOUR HOME FROM PANASONIC/SANYO, the service person may be DANGEROUS even through they speak very nice to you"". Regarding the tv, 1. It will be good for first time buyers, who moving from CRT to LED. 2. Sound quality and pic quality was just average, not so great since only 5MW speakers. 3. White color showing up in little bluish at some channels. 4. Viewing angles from side is not good. We had place it in center of hall, but only who sits opposite could enjoy watching. Not more than 30-45 degree (their advertisement shows 180). 5. You may have few accessories missing from wall mount. That you may need to buy from outside. If at all you don't see better other product outside, then go for Sanyo. Thanks Vasanth",I bought the TV after seeing so many good reviews about the Good Service,B07H7WPV7D

"Bought this TV last month and is using it since then. Sanyo being a good old Japanese brand and being very pocket friendly is the reason I went for this TV. The picture and the audio clarity are really good for this price point. The TV looks good and sleek. The experience of watching HD TV content is really good. The remote is simple and there are many connectivity options, which is a plus. The installation was done by Panasonic technician, who installed the TV on the wall using the wall mount that came with the TV. Only problem I faced is that the audio was not played for some 1080p videos via USB. 720p videos played without any fuss though.

"Good product, don't worry just go for it. Now come the doubts 1. Picture quality and sound quality not good? Ans- Its a budget television, don't expect Samsung Ultra 4k Quantum dot quality. For the price, you can view hd video with no hiccups and the Pictures quality is decent and sound quality is good and its acceptable. The problem is not with Pictures colour production but its with sharpness, edges and depth detail i.e. Motion blur ( that means you are gonna miss the fine details in skin, edges and hairs) but that the case with every television under 15k, so its not like you are specific. And for the sound, speech and high frequencies are clear, no bass but that you can understand for the price. 2. Not able to view video's and play mp3 through pendrive? Ans- Ya its says that the file format is not supported even when its basic mp4, mkv etc. Its because of the Codec problem. So if you get the problem like above, just check your video codec and convert your video using any video converter, that should solve your problem. Also few suggestion, to improve you picture quality use a good branded fiber Audio video cable, it will help to improve picture and sound quality to some extent. And also lower the Contrast and brightness from 50, keep its between 30-40 and sharpness to 55-65 with medium temperature",A Good product. Read my reviews for doubts clearance,B07H7WPV7D

"This is a ""value for money"" item on Amazon. I paid Rs. 12990 during a Sale period and when opting for a 'lightning deal'. Considering that Sanyo is now a subsidiary of Panasonic, the pricing for this TV is possibly the lowest for a well known brand name. I set it up myself and found it quite user friendly. HD quality was quite impressive when connected to a TataSky HD set top box. However when I played a .mkv file on a pen drive inserted into one of the USB ports, the quality was about average. I played the same .mkv file through a small media player connected to the TV (via an HDMI cable of course) at the second HDMI port and there was a remarkable improvement in video quality. I am not attributing this average performance through the USB port as a defect as I have observed it happens with other popular TVs too. This is where the Sanyo's second HDMI port comes handy. Not many 32"" TVs have two HDMI ports (in this price range). I opted for placing the TV on a console (not on the wall) and fitting the supporting feet was very simple. Being a LED TV, it was very light in weight. All in all a worthwhile purchase if on a budget and have space / distance constrains.","This is a ""value for money"" item on Amazon. ...",B07H7WPV7D

"The product was well delivered before time. The courier was done by Fed Ex, though the service boy was little arrogant. The TV works very fine. Initially there was trouble for USB support.

"Great TV with lots of features at a great price too. So why only 3 stars? The user manual is poorly written. There is no clue on how to assemble it for table top use. One picture shows the TV and the two clamps at the bottom and says ""attach them and you are done""! Not exaggerating, but there is just that one sentence by way of instruction. The user already has the TV and the clamps, knows that they need to be attached, so what guidance is the manual offering?? We figured out how to attach the clamps only to find that holes were untapped and some other holes that did not require any screws were threaded instead! Screws provided look like they are self tapping types but no mention of what tools are needed. We somehow managed to force the screws and make it stand upright, it is still not stable enough.

"Hello friends, this is the best Value-for-Money TV. If you are on a tight budget but want a good quality TV with lots of features, then you should consider this. Please note that Sanyo brand is owned by Panasonic Corporation, so the installation and future service, if needed, will be taken care by Panasonic Corporation. Sanyo and Panasonic are Japanese companies and not Chinese, so you can expect some good standard quality. Coming to this TV, there are 3 variants available on Amazon. 32 inch variant is HD ready (720p) but you can some 1080p content also on it. 43 and 49 inch variants are Full HD. The major difference between the three variants, apart from size, is the speakers. The 32 inch TV has two 5W speakers, whereas the 43 and 49 inch TVs have two 8W speakers, so sound quality on 32 inch TV will be average, not so loud. Sound quality on 43 and 49 inch variants will be better. But still don't expect the sound quality of Sony TVs, they are of superior quality and hence pricey. I would suggest that you also buy a good hi-fi speaker system (preferably with a sub-woofer) with this TV to enhance the sound quality of your TV. There are many good speakers systems available on Amazon, from 2000 to 7000. You can choose depending on your budget. About the ports available on this Sanyo TV, all the 3 variants have - 2 HDMI ports, 2 USB ports, PC IN (VGA and Audio) ports, AV and RF ports. You can connect your PC/Laptops via the VGA or HDMI ports and use it like a large PC Monitor. You can also connect Amazon Fire TV stick or Google Chromecast to stream movies via Amazon Prime, Netflix, etc and you can also browser youtube on this. With all these features your TV becomes a Smart TV. The picture quality is on par with LG/Samsung, on all the 3 variants (32, 43 and 49 inch). Installation will be done by Panasonic service team within 24-48 hours of delivery. If you don't want to wall mount the TV, they will still help you set-up the TV for the first time and give you helpful information on protecting your TV. Amazon delivery and Panasonic service are great. While Amazon takes utmost care to deliver the TV in a safe and perfect condition, in case you receive a damaged/defective TV, don't panic, just take some pictures of damage/defects, send them to Amazon via email to: cs-reply@amazon.in and then call Amazon customer service, they will arrange for a return pick-up of the damaged/defecive TV and also send you a free replacement within 2-4 business days. Overall, this Sanyo TV is a good option for those who want a full featured branded TV within a budget. No other brand offers such TVs in this price range. I hope this review helps you make a purchase decision.","Great value for money TV from Sanyo with lots of Ports. Sound quality is average, better buy separate speaker system.",B07H7WPV7D

I installed it myself and haven't had raised any service requests yet. So not sure how responsive the customer service center is. Would strongly recommend this. PS: This product came with an additional cash back offer on payments made using hdfc cards. I had to do a lot of follow up and escalations for almost 7-8 months to get the cash back.

"Sanyo HD Ready 32"" LED TV is splendid, competing with other top brands. The moment I received the product, I felt the TV looks like a Chinese product as the menu looked pretty outdated. The Sanyo TV's in US are different from the one's manufactured India. Looking at few videos in Youtube, got hope that it is an original Sanyo product (menu and remote control unit looked similar) as the web site for US and India are completely different. The model numbers are also different in both the countries. When questioned about the 10 years panel lifetime claim, support personnel said the TV would last for 10 years if used for 8 hours a day. Approximately, the count is 29,000 hours that Sanyo claims their TV would last. I have a Sanyo 15 years old CD player cum Casette recorder set with speakers which is still working excellent. That is the only reason I bought Sanyo TV. Got it for 12,990 in Oct 1 lightning deal. Absolutely worth every penny. Pros: Picture clarity is brighter and sharp when viewing HD movies. Sound is better than other LED TV's when as there are 2 box speakers embedded inside. Has AV1 and AV2 inputs, a VGA, a headphone out, 2 HDMI, 2 USB - 1 HDMI input has a separate audio out pin. Sanyo gives 1+1 year extended warranty if purchased before 31st Oct 2016. [...] Cons: Menu is absolutely outdated. Sanyo needs to concentrate on cosmetic changes in future products to compete with Sony, LG and Samsung. Screen looks bluish sometimes like hp laptops and lenovo full hd phone's display. The screws provided completely doesn't knock-in. One gets inside and the other one stays bit outside in both left and right sides.",Worth buying!!,B07H7WPV7D

"The best recommended Samsung TV for 2018 is the Samsung 4 Series LED TV. It has good picture quality, with an excellent native contrast ratio and great peak brightness. It has excellent motion handling It produces a decent color gamut and good brightness, great for bright room viewing and also doesn't not affect the pocket of a middle class..

"I bought this TV, As it is an android TV it should have Amazon Prime & Netflix. But both applications are restricted in playstore by MI - So I told them to place a return request but they are not accepting it. Saying you should have to confirm it before placing an order. So now on If i will have to buy any android mobile, I will have to call them and confirm all the thousands of applications which is available in playstore - asking whether this applications are supported in mobile or not.

"The picture quality is not good. Resolution is poor with HD connection of my DTH connected through an HDMI cable even though it's an HD ready TV. I didn't find any difference in picture quality with HDMI and RCA inputs. Greenish hue with pixelated appearance of the image was seen even in close view, perhaps defective. Sound quality is okay in low volume but clarity is lost and crackles with medium to high volume. The built is flimsy. But I admire Amazon for it's customer care services for smooth return and refund of the product for which I would give five stars.",Poor resolution and color saturation.,B07HB7SSPZ
"I will suggest all who are buying this in the name of Smart Android Tv. This is totally pathetic product and you will regret it and when you try to return it Amazon customer care will make a number of excuses and keep your phone on waiting for more than 30 minutes by just transferring call here and there to a different department. Let me tell you why. 1) They say ultra-bright display. You will see your own face while paying youtube video on this tv. what kind of ultra-bright display it is? 2) They say built-in chromecast . A built-in chromecast which does not support any Netflix, Amazon. Tell me what kind of chromecast is on this tv? 3) They mentioned on the HDMI port as HDMI ARC. When I try to connect tv with my home theater it not delivering any sound to home theater. I try it by playing youtube on TV. 4) While writing this review. I am on call with Amazon. It has been 32 minutes and Amazon customer care is transferring my call to next and next department and nobody assures me that they will return the product or refund me. I will upload a video of how the display quality it. Please do not purchase in the name of Android instead purchase a normal tv with IPS display.",Pathetic video quality.,B07HB7SSPZ
"I bought it in October. Got delivered fast, on October 13 i got this tv ans has been using it ever since. Today on January 4th, the Android suddenly crashes and displays this message. There is an option to factory reset but nothing is happening. Now have to give this to some customer care centre to get it fixed. When it works, it is real good. WHEN IT WORKS. Update: I contacted Mi customer care yesterday and they were able to resolve the issue in no time. I was concerned that i had to take it to the service centres or send to back to Mi like we do for mobile replacement. To my surprise i was told that THERE ARE NO SERVICE CENTRES CURRENTLY FOR Mi TV's. No service network at all. The customer care executive told me If the issue exists even after the fix is tried, i had to register for an installation request and then have the technician coming in for TV installation take a look at the TV to fix the issue. Other than that, I don't think Mi has any service options for their customers.",MUST READ THIS BEFORE BUYING: Android in it crashed within 3 months : It was an easy fix though.,B07HB7SSPZ

With some efforts using computer we can install some apps like (Amazon Prime Video, Netflix & Chrome) 4. We could not choose default TV Input(AV Mode) when we put on TV. Because of this every time we have to choose input source for AV Mode.

"I have been purchasing multiple products over Amazon since its advent, sometimes even amounting to 1 lakh. I haven't reviewed a single item ever in my life. This time I am forced to. A brief timeline: A) Since this product was an Android TV at a steal price, I bought it, until realizing a big gaffe I had made. B) I received the product on 28th October. I was told not to unbox it until MI support did so. C) Mi support unboxes and wall mounts the TV on 31st. To both of our surprise, the remote is not present in the box. D) As a guileless person who trusts values, I thought it of a minor mistake and raised a case with MI care. Even Mi installation guy raised a case internally. E) After numerous followups (spending almost 2+hours), I was apprised on 1st Nov that ""as per internal investigation was done by MI, the package delivered to me was intact"". F) I have been still following up with MI, and the TV is useless because it needs remote for the initial setup. In a nutshell, we all believe MI products are great. The phones definitely are but cannot say exactly about TVs. I understand we all tend to buy amazing products at great deals. Everyone should. But one needs to be careful of why still Samsung or Sony are finest. That is because they value their customers. It is all about ethics and principles. If MI cannot trust the integrity of its customers, then neither am I bound to.","Be cautious of MI support. No offence to Amazon, which has been great as always.",B07HB7SSPZ
"This has to best among all smart TVs below 20K available in market today and let me tell you why. Crystal clear picture quality. I have Samsung and Sony Led in other rooms purchased at much higher price but still MI TV delivers at par with Sony and much better than Samsung. Guys there is hardly any difference in Full HD and HD ready at 32 Inch size. I found no recognizable difference when both content played even side by side. Inbuilt Andriod Play Store, Youtube, Pathwall and Chrome Cast is amazing. You can play any file format including 4K content smoothly. DTS Sound quality is mesmerising. Gives you perfect cinematic experience. My Sony Bravia and Samsung counterparts in other rooms are no where close in sound quality. The only con I found was ease to connect chromcast. You need to download Google Home app in smartphone which you want to connect.",Gives you much more Value than its Price,B07HB7SSPZ

"Strongly do not recommend this TV. SMART TV Features - NO Netflix, NO Amazon Prime Video. Even using inbuilt Chromecast, we CANNOT cast from Netflix / Amazon Prime Video mobile apps - DISGUSTING. DISPLAY - Absolutely worst display. There are bright spots at random locations on the screen, the picture clarity is also very bad. Colors are not accurate too. THIS IS NOT a A+ grade panel. SOUND - Worst sound output ever i have seen on a TV. Sound is distorted and not audible CLEARLY. Can't even hear the words properly. Must be some cheap Chinese speakers. Not many useful apps in the google play store. A big let down. Did a BIG MISTAKE by buying this TV. Totally REGRET it. Suggest you to go for A+ panel displays. This is no Smart TV with missing netflix and prime video apps inbuilt. All the other stupid apps like hungama, etc, we need to signup which is a headache. My sincere suggestion - DO NOT BUY MI TVs. They are worst than MICROMAX Tvs. Total waste of money buying this Mi TV.",WILL NOT RECOMMEND,B07HB7SSPZ

I ordered for the mi led and it gives me the installation date of 20 October. However I received the message on 18 October and I was satisfied but due to the reasons I was out of station and my parents were at home. They ask the service men to fix the setup box stand but he totally refuse to do so. Even for changing the position of drill holes he demand 250rs extra for each. His behavior was very rude. I'm highly disappointed with the service of MI and would only give 1 star to its service as there is no option of zero,Installation experience very pathetic,B07HB7SSPZ
"This television is definitely a perfect balance between price and performance especially during flash sale at an exceptional price of ₹12500. Performance ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ----------------------- The processor in this Smart TV is powerful enough to play 4K 10bit HEVC videos right out of the box. VLC or MX player can be installed for enhanced media support. Picture Quality ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ -------------------------- Many people complain about the overbright screen. But it can be compensated by adjusting the display settings. These are my preferred settings. Backlight :1 to 20 ********************* During night even the lowest value of 1 is bright enough and can watch content without hurting eyes. During day time adjust it as per your requirement depending on your ambient lighting conditions. A maximum of 20 would be enough. Setting backlight to minimum improves black levels, reduces power consumption, increases LED life and reduces eye strain especially during night. Brightness :48 ***************** Brightness setting controls black level. Increasing brightness reduces black levels and hence reduces contrast. Brightness at 50, pictures looks washed out with poor blacks and color saturation At 45 black looks deep but lots of details at dark areas are lost while watching movies. 48 is an optimal setting to my eyes with good blacks and not so lack of details. Contrast : 40 to 45 ********************* Contrast setting controls white level. Contrast can be set anywhere between 40 and 45. Increasing contrast too much may cause highlight areas in a picture, like bright skies or shiny objects might look overexposed. As the screen itself is very bright, increasing contrast further makes whites look over bright. Also colors gets washed out while increasing contrast. Saturation: 45 to 50 ************************ Color saturation can be set anywhere between 45 to 50. At 45 colors look more natural. At 50 colors looks a bit punchy. But still its a personal preference. At the above settings, the black levels and colors were pleasing while watching demo videos of OLED TVs on YouTube at 1080p . The following Youtube videos help you to check the black level quality of the TV. LG 4K OLED Beauty Of Black Demo LG OLED Eclipse 2 Demo LG HD Demo Art Nouveau Full HD and 4K videos looks sharp in this TV. Downloaded a sample 4K HEVC video named 'Life Untouched' and also a 4K HEVC sample of the movie Elysium. Both of them played smoothly on the TV with very good details. Screen Quality ⭐⭐⭐⭐ -------------------------- I think this is a VA panel , the quality of which sits right in between TN and IPS panels. The screen is glossy and hence reflective. This might be a problem if the TV is placed in a room with windows facing it. Like all other LCD panels, this also has also got uneven screen uniformity but that's only noticed in plain dark grey backgrounds. While watching movies or other content it's not at all a problem. Screen non uniformity is a common issue even with high end TVs of big brands like LG Samsung etc. Luckily there's no backlight bleeding in the unit I received. Viewing angles are average with some loss of contrast even at low angles but that's a common VA panel characteristic. IPS panels with good viewing angles can't be expected at this price point. All LCD panel technologies have their strengths and weaknesses. IPS panels have good viewing angles but has poor black levels. VA panels excels in black depth despite it's average viewing angles and this TV has got very impressive black levels. Sound Quality ⭐⭐⭐⭐ -------------------------- Here the TV falters a bit. Bass is a bit weak but is very loud even at low volume. Midrange and treble are very good. Even minute high pitched click and tick sounds in movies can be heard very clearly. Edit: In a previous review I have mentioned these EQ settings sounds good. But it isn't. 100Hz : 7 300Hz : 8 1000Hz : 4 3500 Hz : 6 10000 Hz : 5 A high value of 8 for 300 Hz actually make the sound muddy and muffled. The following settings sounds much better and here's the reason. 100 Hz : 8 - Bass Frequency setting for deep bass male vocals and instruments like Kick Drum,Toms, Snare etc. 300 Hz : 4 - Low Midrange Enhances bass and depth of male vocals. Increasing 300Hz too much makes sounds muddy and muffled reducing clarity of high frequency sounds 1000 Hz : 3 - Midrange Imparts a metallic tone. Increasing makes sound tinny and unpleasant. 3500 Hz : 5 - Upper Midrange Vocals especially female sounds best at this frequency. A value of 5 enhances vocal quality. Increasing too much makes vocals harsh. 10000 Hz : 7 -Treble Adds crispiness and sparkle to vocals and instruments. Enhances tinkling sounds of metallic instruments. Human ear is sensitive to midrange and upper midrange frequencies Here it's 1000 and 3500 Hz. Setting these values too high can cause listening fatigue. Even increasing 300Hz is disturbing. Great sound performance especially bass is not even expected from a television in this budget. But considering its midrange frequency, clear treble and loudness, it deserves 4 stars. Remote Control ⭐⭐⭐⭐ ----------------------------- Minimalism is great. But minimalism with less functionality is not so great. Addition of Mute,TV Settings and Video input selection buttons would 've made the remote more functional. App support ⭐⭐⭐⭐ ----------------------- Many are complaining about lack of Netflix and Amazon prime on this TV. Xiaomi says they are working with Netflix to soon make it available. When they're done with it ,Netflix issue will be solved. I really don't care about Netflix. What that matters to me is movie playback capabilities of various formats and it does an excellent job with the support for media player apps like VLC and MX player. An excellent processor with HEVC hardware acceleration makes it a perfect multimedia platform. 4 stars for now and 5 stars when Netflix arrives. Pros and Cons --------------------------- Pros: 1. Powerful processor for 4K media playback. 2. App installation via USB 3. Built in Chromecast 4. Bluetooth remote 5. Voice Command Cons: (Update) Previously the main issues with the TV were the lack of Autoplay function and Standby option. But in the latest update both these issues are solved. Now when the TV is turned on it will automatically go to the previous Input source To enable it, go to Settngs >Inputs > Enable 'Stay on the previous source' option. Screen off feature is also added in the new update. Long pressing Power button will show Screen Off option. Now the TV is much better and the only one con according to me is the lack of miracast. 1. Miracast is missing. Only Chromecast is available, which works only for some specific apps. Google home app has to be installed on the phone for full fledged mirroring. Miracast is a versatile mirroring protocol that can mirror anything on the phone and doesn't need an app like Google Home to work. To sum up: -------------------- Overall considering the picture quality, powerful hardware and the price, the TV definitely deserve 5 stars devoid of it's average audio quality and the glossy screen because there are no other TVs in market with such features at this price point. Judging this TV just because of lack of Netflix isn't fair. Also Xiaomi now has got very strong service support across India. New brands like iFFalcon, Blaupunkt ,Thomson etc might provide better options at a competitive price. But when it comes to service centres, it's a dead end. I am very much satisfied with the purchase.",Priceworthy.,B07HB7SSPZ
"Value for money. Google play store , youtube etc. works fine. Side loaded apps works fine except a few Picture quality is great. Sound is however not awesome. Got it for 13.5 thousand thanks to Amazon offers. Delivery and installation both were great.",Worth the price.,B07HB7SSPZ
"Good quality for the price as i got it for 12-13k . Its an hd ready tv not full hd but still plays 4k and 1080p videos in satisfactory manner. Good sound quality. One star less for not having netflix and amazon prime which is essentially required anywhere now. Edit in Oct 2019 : Netflix and Prime added in the latest update , both working fine After a year of use tv still great also sound quality great. Changing my 4 stars to 5 stars. :-)",Good product for the price,B07HB7SSPZ
"First of all 1 star for delivery. Paid extra amount for next day delivery but product delivered after 2 days. (Tip: Don't pay extra for fast delivery option specially on Great Indian Festival) For installation and demo 5 star. Coming to TV, TV is smart with android os but display is average. Display- 3/5 Sound- 4/5 Display looks more brighter. There are no options to change colour settings, only brightness and contrast can be changed. Looking for smart tv around 14k then look for it. But have extra budget and want better display go for other options. Will update about smart features after few days of use. Thank you",Smart TV with average display,B07HB7SSPZ
"MI has claimed Indian market on the mobile category though I don't own one, but my friends and relatives experience has been great. With that in mind, I bought this TV. Pros: 1 )Slim design and Bezels maintained as much as possible to the edge, weighs barely 4 kg. 2) Multiple ports including Ethernet, HDMI, USB, wifi, Built in chrome cast, Always connected to my broadband. 3) Audio quality is good with DTS-HD, Android Oreo UI is great and it's fast as well. 4) TV quality is good, if you have HD DTH that would be great, no problem with viewing angles. 5) Smart TV UI has various customization options, I also installed some apps that provide Free shows, movies, like Hotstar, Jio TV, Jio cinema, Movies HD. Some of these have many inventory of free HD movies and shows and ofcourse YouTube. Also you can update apps to get the latest changes. Really worth it. 6) MI patchwall is awesome, it's similar to Hotstar with many freebies including Erosnow, Jio cinema, Hooq and Epic. 7) Bluetooth remote with Google assistant works like a charm also Built in Chromecast also works fast with phones. 8) TV stand that came with it is strong and strudy, still I mounted it on wall, not through them, I bought a Swivel mount so that I can swing it to side to side when required. Overall I don't think why no one will buy this for such a steal! Cons: The only con I found worthy of posting is this. 1) Prime video support. It's amazing or unbelievable! I'm buying this from Amazon through prime, yet they haven't partnered with MI ! Prime video app fails in this TV! Why Amazon? I think MI and Amazon should work it out for prime video support. I'm currently watching prime via a workaround. I downloaded chrome and logging in prime via Mouse attached to USB, like PC and watching it. PS: As I said before in the cons, I read that they will plan to put an OTA update for prime video soon. Those who are bashing this TV, expect an OLED TV quality from 14-15k! And probably should check their phone networks (WiFi and data) before chromecasting. I didn't have any problem.",Value for Money( Honest Review),B07HB7SSPZ
My overall experience till now I awesome.. it's best for low budget and now we get Netflix and Amazon Prime working after update. I am playing with my PS4 slim on it. Quality is not best but good enough under this price.. Pros : 1. Good picture quality in this price. 2. Working fine with my PS4 Slim. 3. Netflix & Amazon working after recent update. 4. Screen mirroring working fine can watch Airtel TV with that. 5. USB support is working grate. Cons : 1. Hotspot is not a good option may work slow. It happen with me I have OnePlus 3T I connect it to my hotspot both Jio and Airtel none of them works.. anyway I took internet connection from local cable. 2. Have limited app in playstore.,Superb.

"This time Amazon took long to deliver my product as there was durga puja holidays. Item reached my nearest hub very fast. But from there it took 4 days to reach at my home. Now I will enter into my main review. I opened the package myself. There was free table top installation but I was so much excited and hence I unbox and installed myself. I was really worried about the quality of the TV as well as the picture quality. After turning on the tv when the display appears and I saw the entire display is intact then I feel myself safe. Automatic android and app finalizing will be done. Just you have to provide the google account details. It will take not more than 10 mins. Now coming to the picture quality. I am using a normal set top box of siti cable. So I really didn't check the quality with that. The picture is so brighter. I adjusted manually. And when I lowered all the paremeters, found very eye soothing. Colour quality is very good. I have a samsung full hd tv. And this is a HD ready tv. I found this mi tv's colour is very soothing and eye relaxing. Then I checked with HD video in youtube. I really amazed with the display quality. This TV really gives a masterstroke playing the HD videos. I feel this HD ready TV's picture quality is more fine than my samsung full hd tv. Every time I spoke to the remote and it understand my every word. And play automatically. You need a good wifi connection otherwise google will delay to listen your words. I will not give full marks for the sound quality. The voice quality is very nice. But bass is very low. But it is nice and loud. I really recommend the TV to everyone who are not a brand lover. Just have a try. No doubt you will be feel amazed. I got panicked viewing some negative reviews. I don't know with which tv they are comparing. But with respect to a hd ready tv it is a must buy cheapest all rounder tv.",A must buy cheapest all rounder tv,B07HB7SSPZ
Display is worst and coming dull and color is being bleeding. Not at worth for price and i recommend to go for another brand,Amazon and MI are cheating customers with TCL manufactured TV,B07HB7SSPZ
"The so called Mi Android TV.. I have been waiting for this product for quite a some time and at last here I am writing this review.. So you get pre installated apps like hotstar, Google play store etc.. but If you want to use Amazon prime and Netflix you need to side load these apps.. Amazon prime works fine but Netflix doesn't. The picture quality is good and the viewing angles are also nice. I had only one issue with this TV the screen mirroring is not working fine. I tried to cast few photos onto the TV but it gets stuck.. There is some issue with the inbuilt chrome cast I guess because the Google photos app is also very glicthy I was not able to cast the photos. I hope MI comes up with a fix for this in the next update. Apart from this issue you don't see any problems with the TV.",Awesome TV at this price range.. but..,B07HB7SSPZ
"1) Netflix doesn't work, app gets installed but gives some error on playing. Even casting netflix from your phone doesn't work. 2) No support for Amazon prime app via google play store. 3) Picture quality is very bad, even my parents who don't know much about TVs don't like its picture quality, I had to disable the adaptive brightness and keep the backlight at max to see some colours, otherwise the display seemed faded and dull. 4) Sound Quality is ok. 5) Installation service was prompt and timely done. 6) 400/- Rs. paid for wall mount, which is free with LG/Sony etc. 7) Manufacturing is done by TCL, its written on the box. MI is just rebranding it and selling. Overall waste of money, please but few thousand rupee more and go for standard brands like LG, Sony, Samsung, at least you will get good picture quality. MI compromised on the most important aspect of TV i.e. the display.","Bad picture quality, no netflix or amazon prime support",B07HB7SSPZ
"1)After 10 days, Google assistant not responding (Remote Google assistant button) even though you're connected to internet 2) Picture quality not good when you use Cable and Non HD plans 3)We cannot download all the apps from Google play.There are limitations 4) Google cast not good. When you play a movie through Google cast or mirror cast , There is a lot of lagging. 5)If you have mounted your TV on wall, it is difficult to connect a USB or any another devices.For that you have to buy a extension cable. 6)you cannot change the TV channels through the TV remote.You have to buy IR cable to make it functional(for DTH ). 7) Out of 8 gb you will get 3 to 4gb internal memory 8)Table mount stands are not good 9)For wall mount you have to pay 400 rupees extra",Google assistant in the remote not responding,B07HB7SSPZ
"Netflix , Hoichoi ,Amazon app not working. I have purchased the TV only to watch these. Tell me what should I do.

The TV takes a lot problem in getting connected with our mobile I.e bluetooth. also the screen mirroring does not work. Picture quality is also not so good.While the installation of the TV the fellow man didn't explain us the settings and that made a problem .

"I got this TV for my brother, since my previous experience with Mi TV 4A was good and this TV has added Chromecast and in-built mic feature. Unluckily the TV started showing-up software issues. It restarts automatically in mid of watching. Reached-out to MI Service and the Service men who attended this said me that it's an existing bug and it will be fixed in next software update (and nothing they can do about it). It's been a month after this visit, still no updates and my issue remains same. I checked with my colleagues and they have also reported same restart issues which can't be resolved at all. BUY THIS and LIVE with SOFTWARE issue is the verdict here !",Software issues,B07HB7SSPZ
Netflix is not support by both MI android tv app and its inbuilt chrome cast. Highly disappointed with it. Called MI customer care and they said that it won’t support. This is very basic feature of any smart tv and should be declared before selling it.,Netflix is not supported,B07HB7SSPZ

I just bought the fire stick 3 weeks back and the HDMI ports are giving me cracking sound for audio and picture breaking badly and I am just 10 days out of warranty and they wouldn't even cover servicing due to that plus doesn't have any grace period.

Also I see slight white cloudy tint on display. The sound is also not at all clear, while watching a movie you won't be able to figure out the dialogues without a subtitle on it. Poor sound. The build of the TV is also not so good. The outer frame if you press it, you will dear breaking it. Now coming back to Amazon, it's not even ten days and I'm trying to place a return request.

"You all must have read the reviews regarding specs, performance etc. My review is based on view point of a normal user, even more so from a user who has just upgraded from CRT. Put on HD subscription (DTH or cable) and then you will see the picture quality. It's awesome. The 32 inch HD ready model is an ideal size for HD channels as they generally are 720p. You can see the attached pictures for estimating picture quality, the second one is from YouTube at 720p. From the experience I had at Xiaomi Service Center with my phone, I can gladly tell you can trust it's service. After the update, the sound quality is subtly improved. The best thing about this is, you can even cast your laptop using chrome, I don't think others provide this application. Amazon Prime is soon to be supported and Netflix isn't. I can live with that. Don't worry if you don't find any music apps in play store. Just tell Google assistant what you wanna play and it will play in whatever app you want, be it gaana, Saavn or wynk. So yeah, no complaints so far. I would advice you to use a stabilizer IF you are using government's electricity service. And yes, don't book your installation on Sunday even if it shows it's available, they are not. To those who are saying you can't make AV or any of the HDMI as default. Go to APPS - Live TV, add this to favorites, so you can directly access cable from interface. Now in Patchwall whichever mode you will select, will be set as default when you open Live TV app from interface, there you go! Go for it!",Just don't judge it!,B07HB7SSPZ
"Pros: - The TV looks good. Has a nice aesthetic appeal. - Picture quality is good. I bought the 32 inch HD Ready one. It's not entirely HD, but you can play HD stuff on it. - The Patchwall OS has received a nice upgrade from the previous one. So the content is more manageable and fluid. - The voice assistant feature is a nice edition to the remote. Not very fast, but still a nice feature to have! - Built-in Chromecast, so you can directly stream content from you device which is also pretty neat! (With some limitations) - Accessible PlayStore with a large variety of apps available directly(Some limitations) Cons: - As you must have heard, there's not Netflix or Prime default support. You have go through a little manual process to get them working. Even then you can't use Netflix without a mouse and a keyboard(A later update has solved this keyboard issue, yet to test) - You do have access to the Google PlayStore, but some important apps are restricted. So it's a feature, but not entirely useful. - The built-in chromecast also doesn't allow you to stream Netflix or Prime content. You have to download them seperately (sideload) - The assistant doesn't work if you attach headphones to the TV, so just a warning to anyone who uses it that way. - Sound quality is not that great. There's very limited bass. Although the sound is quite high, it doesn't have a nice quality to it. It sounds flat sometimes Overall, A decent TV with nice picture quality. Built-in chromecast within a good budget. Can access blocked apps through sideloading. So only purchase it if you're ok making changes to the tv and installing apps from outside sources",Decent TV.,B07HB7SSPZ
"First of all I was too excited about MI TV. Installation was done after 15 days of delivery because of irresponsible engineer who wrongly mentioned installed status. When it comes to quality picture quality is ok. Sound quality is not great. Build material is so cheap. Most important thing is that it's Android TV with lots of software bugs. 1) WiFi is not working properly even after installation of latest firmware. 2) Bluetooth connection with any speaker is too tough. TV is spending time in finding device. Paired device is not automatically connected via Bluetooth. 3) You can not install Netflix, Amazon Prime and many other apps directly.

I have ordered this tv on 23 jan 2019 and installation is done on 27 jan Till now it works fine but on 3 may (approx 3 months later) i find there are black spots on the my tv screen.......its only 3 months old n i find this big problem with this tv what is the guarantee that tv will works for atleast 2-3 years..... Plzz i request to refund/replace my tv My frnd also have same issue with this tv after 6 months and he got replacement of tv,Very bad experience,B07HB7SSPZ
I purchased this product on 18 Oct within a month I started having lot of tech problems. The operating system keeps crashing. In the middle of watching something it happened a lot of times now lost count. Have to reset it whenever the OS crashes. After the technician resets the problem reoccurs again. The MI service has just informed me that replacement is not available after first 10 days. Which is not a good thing. The problem here is a technical issue of system crash but still they dont have a replacement of TV. It's waste if the system crashes you cannot use it for any purpose. Also had a trouble with the remote which runs on Bluetooth pairing which dysfunctioned too soon within six months of purchase. Also there is no Amazon prime or Netflix support cannot download from the play store as well. I watch only hotstar and YouTube on TV The Netflix cannot be directed casted from the app on this TV also. You can only chrome cast I.e Tab cast but the picture quality is horrible and black looks purple on TV after casting. If the OS crashes this TV cannot be used for anything and is a total waste of money and time. DONT BY THIS PRODUCT UNLESS THERE IS A GOOD GUARANTEE OR WARRANTY OPTION FOR REPLACEMENT OF FAULTY PRODUCT LIKE I GOT,Too many tech issues system crash and not so smart TV,B07HB7SSPZ
"The price point tipped my buying decision in its favour. Pros: Dimensions & Weight - Compared to my previous TV, this is much lighter and thin bezels Connectivity - 2 USB, 3 HDMI, AV Cons: HD Ready & not Full HD Android is quite buggy, Google Assistant stopped working on day 2 No Netflix, No Prime Video - I had to use an Apple TV box to get access to these apps MIUI Tieup content needs separate logins/signup/payment Disappointing pre loaded software - No chrome etc Overall - I am not sure if it was a wise buy except the price point",Budget Buy,B07HB7SSPZ
Its only 3 months that I have owned this so called smart TV. It hangs like anything. I have registered two complaints already. The hanging problem did not got resolved and now the Bluetooth remove and google voice assistant is not working. Don't waste your hard earned money on such Chinese products. The technician told me that its a mother board error and now I have issue with the remote.,Don't go for this Smart Tv,B07HB7SSPZ
"Picture quality is really so bad. The disply colors look faded, too bright and blured...A waste product of Xioami. Another major complaint of the tv is that doesnt have default input setting, we have to power on the tv and select avi/hdmi option everytime which is ridiculous and not acceptable at all....the xioami support team needs to correct this with a software update immediately. Yes, really waste of money. .....Sureshji",Picture quality is so bad.,B07HB7SSPZ

"I purchased this product from a different website during the launch sale for ₹12,500. Although the picture quality and sound is pretty good for a TV of this price, there's nothing smart about it. All Mi TVs don't support the major streaming apps like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video. It's so pathetic - you should rather buy a cheaper TV and purchase Fire TV Stick by Amazon, which gives more features than this TV.","No Netflix, Prime Video support.",B07HB7SSPZ

"Hi, I am a big fan of Xiomi products. They always worked perfactly. But i am not happy with my recent purchase of Mi 4C pro TV. The TV is good but there is so much to improve in software part. 1. There is no auto AV select on boot option. There are older members in our family and they are not able to handle new OS like interface and they just want to watch good old Set Top Box Channels. It was a simple option in previous version of MI TV 4A so why it is not available in this one? Temporary Solution :- You can select Live TV app in TV and set it as the first app in home screen. So whenever you tv starts it will be the first app selected by default and by pressing select (big middle round button) Set Top Box will start. 2. There is no instant TV on option. It is available in other same category android tv. After shutting down we have to wait for the whole OS to load again. 3. I bought MI IR cable and it is detected by Live TV Guide app in main screen but whenever i select a channel it says the cable is not connected. I have tried resetting the TV and still not working. It was working fine in previous tv why is it not working in this one. Please help. 3. Why can't i use the built in bluetooth as a regular normal bluetooth like sending files and more. When android is available there in tv and we are paying for it why not let us use it at its full potential. 4. It's a android TV and no time is displayed on home screen. I have always liked Mi for its full support for the customers. I hope they will come up with solutions and release an update as soon as possible.","MI 4 C Pro - Good TV, Bad Software",B07HB7SSPZ
"I got this LED Tv at Rs13499 at first sale, i like the features below is the some Pros and Cons Pros: Built in google apps including playstore so you can download any app you want very easily. Built in Chromecast which is a very great feature, i love this It has both android and patchwall. so you can feel the customized features that Mi has put in patchwall. 8 GB internal memory out of with you will get 4.2GB for your use remaining is already occupied by android system. It supports Bluetooth which will help you to connect your Bluetooth speaker, Keyboard, mouse, headphone etc. It also has google voice assistant so senior members of family would easily operate it. Remote is Bluetooth connected. Cons: Default color settings are little fade but i customized it from settings. They don't give wall mount and remote batteries in the pack so you'll have to spend more than 400 above the base price of LED. I felt LED stand is not that good. It was of cheap quality though i didn't used it as i mounted LED on the wall. No Support for Amazon Prime Video WiFi Disconnection issue even after update Wifi connection is not reliable and TV hang sometime Overall product is worth its price.",Good TV with nice features,B07HB7SSPZ
"Really a value for money product. I had to buy this after my age old CRT tv broke down beyond repairs. Got only 500 for it under exchange. The only problem I faced in first 3 months was the issue in connecting to home wifi, it used to take many minutes & multiple attempts to get it connected to wifi. But after a software update in January 2019, it started working well & now connects to home wifi quickly. The picture quality is quite good, looking at the price point of about 12k, bought it in Oct 2018. It connects & remains paired with my JBL Flip 3 bluetooth speaker easily. Streaming from my Samsung, Redmi & Lenovo mobiles is also easy over wifi. Voice recognition also works well. Very limited number of apps are enabled for android TV, however, you can also install additional apps using APK files from USB. Ok for browsing the Internet - had to download Puffin Browser. It takes sometime to get used to the quite hard remote buttons. Remote is very slim & sleek. As the remote is Bluetooth enabled, no need to point it directly to TV. I wish there was a direct setting to open/start the DTH/Cable input by default, as it is quite difficult to operate for elders in the family, as they don't know the remote navigation functions. I read someone complaining about not being able to install and run apps like Amazon Prime & Netflix on this TV. Please note that it is Amazon & Netflix's decision to not support this Android TV. Hence don't blame Xiaomi for this issue. It is due to the corporate fight between Google vs Amazon & Netflix. And has nothing to do with the capabilities of this TV.","I thought of giving 4 stars but after recent software update, changed it to 5 stars",B07HB7SSPZ

"well i got the TV today intact, loved the packaging, no harm done to the hardware. now coming to the installation, contacted the store through the link in the mail i received for installation, the guy was polite, did in 10 minutes and left (no charges). in the box, there was one remote, one tv, table top stand and the ac adapter, although i thought the delivery man will give the AAA batteries for the remote but nevermind, thats hardly an issue to consider. the audio quality is great for a 11k TV with android OS as its base. I read reviews about how netflix nd prime was not deployed. So, as soon as i started the TV, i ran a update check nd found the update of Android 9. the TV came with version 8. in the new version, it eas clearly stated that its now supporting the netflix and lrime officially. the update was of 825 mb. after the update the netflix was preinstalled nd prime was easy to install through play store. both are running seamlessly. coming to casting, yes it is possible through google home app, and if ur phone is having inbuilt casting mechanism then too no problem at all. i casted my phone nd it worked like a charm. video quality is great. i ran 720p, 1080p nd 4k, and it was running without any stutter or lag. the customization is pretty great. the UI is catchy and easy to understand nd use. The voice recognition feature works well, although you need the internet connection to make it work for anything. what i think is Xiaomi should at least enable the recognition system for basic local tv functions. I meant that yes i can turn the volume up nd down, change channels by speaking, but that too requires an internet connection. please resolve this. also, there is no mute function on Mi tv remote. i know its hard to change the hardware but u can give an update where we can press or hold a certain button to mute and unmute. most of the content to watch is free and yes its categorized in a great way. the table top atand is sturdy. the look is sleek and classy. loved the product. great job Mi. and please take the two things i mentioned into consideration in ur next update, the mute thing and the localization of voice assistant for basic rv functions. and to the negative reviewers, if u r asking for a smart tv, then at least be smart to explore everything from start to end, then place ur conclusions, nothing would be spoon feeded to u guys. thanks. have a great day.",Update before posting baseless reviews,B07HB7SSPZ
"I am writing this review after 5 month of use. Best feature in this TV is Patchwall, Google Assistant, Built in Chrome cast. Whereas as we know MI is an China company so how can we expect that they will deliver good quality product. Product built quality is so poor, sometimes my TV auto reboot my family members always complaining me for this TV. Sometimes speaker went off, Due to low Ram I always face speed issue while browsing sometimes screen freeze. Overall I will give 2 stars out of 5 stars.

"Great picture quality at affordable price, sound quality is an outlier in otherwise perfect product. I'm really impressed with the specifications and price. tested and amazed with picture quality as well. interface is smooth and easy to hands-on. app references are given but you have to download all of them as you wish. cons: one and only disappointment. Sound. .sound quality is below par . equalisation definitely has some issue, you need to have remote in hand all the time to control ever changing high and low dBs from dialogues to songs in movie/series. .sound clarity is okayish. #Cant ask for a better product at such price range. hope a patch will come for the sound asap.",Best of the best,B07HB7SSPZ

"Remote has less than basic features. Old TVs had basic buttons and limited functions so could do most of the tasks from TV buttons as well but still those TVs also had lot of buttons on remote whereas smart TV has lot of features and remote is the only tool you have to control it. MI remote doesn't have Mute button so forget about other functions. Oh and it takes ages typing with this remote. You better buy 2in1 remote online which has both touch and keyboard features. Really, you will have to spend lot of time to do normal things with this TV and remote. There are 2 modes to access channels/apps. TV interface is hard to manage, you can customize little bit on app interface but it is almost impossible to make the changes in Patchwall. I tried watching videos but that does not help. You are stuck with the random serials/movies/channels on tabs on Patchwall. I'm using wi-fi with good speed so streaming was ok but TV LAGS SEVERAL TIMES, you have to clear cache and everything. Voice assistant response is also SLOW now. You can boost and clear cache from inbuilt TV manager app but still I'm not happy, you can take a chance. Display is nice, no complaints about that. Sound is also good for this price. To conclude, I will say go with branded TVs like Sony, etc. They will cost more but trust me it is worth it. I hope this helps you to decide, I was wrong with my decision.",Not recommended,B07HB7SSPZ
"I bought this as a second TV for my bedroom and now I am repenting why I did not buy bigger size TV. Got it as an exchange for my 10 year old LG TV and with credit card discount at 11k. Pros : 1. Patch wall , although has old collection, is a clear differentiator compared to other 32 inch non smart TVs from LG, Samsung and Sony. It has lot of regional content and is improving. Agreed that it is SDish ; but still is good. My old fire TV stick works with the only exception that for Netflix, audio needs to be set back to stereo as 5.1 output does not work. 2. Inspite of being just HD ready, HD content looks good (but not as great as my old LG HD ready) Cons: 1. Sound is loud but audio clarity is not good. Looks like outpur is bass heavy which makes the dialogues less clear at high volume. 2. Not rugged like LG and Sony. Handle with care if you plan to shift homes. Very delicate. 3. 32 inch looks puny. Go for 43 and Full HD. 4. No Alexa integration. Being an android TV, it is easy to give this feature.",More Value for the 💰 with Regional content.,B07HB7SSPZ

"I'll write this review as a layman. I don't know much about the technicalities. Everything about this TV is top notch. It has all the features of a smartphone except calling and camera feature. Sound quality - Excellent. Picture quality - Excellent. It looks sleek and stylish. You can install apps in it, comes with 8 GB storage.(I was amazed by this feature.) I haven't recharged by setup box, I have been using apps like sonyliv, voot, hotstar etc. for free. Extremely satisfied with the product. Bindass kharido.

"Totally a waste products plz don't go for this product I am regretting after purchasing this Mi TV. Reasons : 1. No net flix & amazon prime video. 2. Zero functionality on remote, you always have to go setting manually & change the picture quality or sound quality If you want to, you can't change those in middle of your show or movie you have to totally go back & change the settings. 3. No button functionality on TV, so this means if your remote is lost you can't see the TV until you find your remote. 4. More importantly I want to replace this product but I was unable to do so as the service provider denied to do so.

"I was using Mi Led TV 4A from last 6-7 months. I bought this Mi led TV 4C Pro one week ago. Talk about build quality it's made by plastic & good enough at this price point. It's light weight & design is almost similar to Mi LED TV 4A. Picture quality is not the very best but it's good. Resolution is 1366×768 means it is only a HD ready panel. I checked on tv upto 4k videos on YouTube & full hd videos on USB drive was playing smoothly but after 720p no major difference in quality of video on higher resolution. I feel little bit better quality display in comparison of Mi LED TV 4A. One thing to notice on display that corners are little but darker when your screen is white. Overall picture quality is acceptable. Sound output is almost same as Mi Led TV 4A. It comes with 10w×2 two speakers setup & it is loud & clear upto 70% volume. I feel little bit distortion on high volume but I say it is one the best the sound output in TVs in this price segment. Now talk software/os it runs on Android 8.1 & Patchwall. Android gives you freedom to download tons of apps from play store which is already available on tv. You can set up your android smartphone with tv. Share your smartphone content to tv easily through Google cast because it comes with Chromecast built in. Youtube works flawlessly if internet speed is good. Patchwall gives lots of content from many online content partners some are free and some paid but it's good. Tv comes with lots of connectivity features. Here is 3×HDMI, 2×USB, AV, 3.5mm audio out, lan port, Bluetooth & wifi. Tv comes with a bluetooth enabled 12 button voice remote which is very useful you can use is from any direction & use voice command from dedicated mic available on remote.

"First impressions: Great smart device but low picture quality so can't call it a smart TV can call it a smart device Update: After 5 days of usage Thought it is a great smart device But after usage a few days found many problems namely 1. WiFi needs to be conected manually Everytime you switch on the tv Intially thought WiFi wasn't in range and I have purchased range extender as tv showing low signal strength and the router getting constantly disconnected even though WiFi router was in the adjacent room with only one wall in-between When I was setting up the range extender I found strength of WiFi signal at the tv is 80% later checked with the mobile and laptop and confirmed it. As anyway I have purchased the range extender, went ahead and installed it just beside tv. Now tv doesn't get disconnected in the middle but I have to manually connect to WiFi every time I switch on the tv. Implies poor WiFi antenna in TV 2.its not a smart device we need a teche to install apps and make tv smart 3. PATCHWALL worst thing I have ever seen It doesn't have any content it its own. It is the app which shows the content of various apps such as ZEE5, voot, hungama play, sunNXT, H&Q, EROS NOW, EPIC ON, ... To view content each of these apps need to be individually installed and have individual subscription as normal user of the apps with no additional discount, on top of it we can't access these apps natively on Android home nor install them there.

You can google what aptoide is. If you are planning to purchase decent 32INCH android tv, this is the one in this price. Voice recognition works pretty fine for me.

"I've bought this TV for 15k but now the price is reduced to 14k. For the price I paid, I'm completely satisfied with the product. Build quality of the TV feels fine for me as I should not expect much for the price I've paid. It's above average. The panel looks good, not the best one out there but it's good for the price, you won't get any better panel at this price point as of now. It supports videos upto 4k which is great thing in my opinion. The speakers on this TV are surprisingly loud but there is no bass at all. So, I would recommend you to connect some good external speakers to it for better sounding experience. If you're planning to use table stand on this TV then you have to increase the diameter of the holes on this TV by tightening and untightening the screws 3 or 4 times in each hole for perfect fit of the stands. I really like the Chromecast feature of this TV, and mainly it's an android TV. The reason that I'm mentioning it as an Android TV is that most of the other brands claim theirs as smart TVs but most of them won't run on android, they just install some multimedia apps and some other apps on the TV and advertise them as smart TVs. But this TV is a pure smart TV as it runs on android Oreo 8.1, I've received two OTA updates since the day I purchased it. If you're planning to buy this TV, I would suggest you to connect this TV to the internet as initial setup takes around 20 mins to go to the home screen. You can install prime video app on this TV too by downloading it from third party websites and installing it via USB.

"This is a nice tv according to the price point. It's android so alot of apps although amazon prime and netflix is still not available and can only be accessed through side loading. Picture quality is good, colors are punchy and display is sharp with good amount of brightness, those who are having problem of low brightness turn off dynamic backlight and increase the amount of backlight from the settings, panel is enough bright but i have noticed that in the corners of the display there is vignetting although it not noticeable to your eyes while watching content but its there. Sound quality is fine don't expect some excellency of sound, it is your typical tv type sound and in terms of that tv type sound its fine, loud enough for a big room even on below 50% volume levels. Rest of the things are also good like durability, availability of ports, features, interface, etc. No complaints so far. So all in all it is a good tv for the price it is asking for!",Enough good for the money you are paying !,B07HB7SSPZ

Product is value for money. Every thing is superb..

I had ordered for MI LED 4C Pro and after installation, when I updated software, it generated Build number as OPM1.171019.011.1010 which is applicable for MI LED TV 4A Pro so plz. clear my doubt, my tv is 4A Pro or 4C Pro which was originally ordered.",Doubts on model,B07HB7SSPZ

"Nice product. It takes only 3 days to deliver the product. Fast service by Amazon. Regarding MI Led TV 4C pro. It is awesome in the price range.

The TV is Pre-installed with a good number of online streaming services includes Zee5, Hungama, etc.. There are free as wells as paid contents available in various apps. By default, there is no Amazon Prime app but you can install it from google store. Netflix is not there by default and not able to install from google store, but you can upgrade Andriod version from oreo to Pie, then you will have Netflix automatically installed.",Review after 1 week of usage,B07HB7SSPZ
"Observations : - Booting the device takes similar time like booting a android smartphone. It's not plug and play like normal TV's. I myself have LG smart TV and good part about that is it boots up fast and plays the channel from DTH and loads the android festures later. We generally use TV for watching channels and not for browsing through various apps. Here even shutting down takes some time. - No channel selector buttons or mouse feature in remote like LG smart TV. In LG I can either use DTH remote or TV remote for changing channels , volume etc. But here once we swtich on the TV we have to take DTH remote to switch on DTH and change channel - Also once TV boots up, everytime we have to manually select setup box from the menu which is cumbersome process especially when you are gifting this product to elderly people. - The picture quality is average and when comparing with LG , picture is not that great. - Bluetooth feature of remote is quite good as we no longer need to show remote directly to the TV - OS is pretty good and is very fast unlike LG webos. Because the processor and RAM is higher than LG. Otherwise LG webOS has much more features. - TV is sleek and has more input and output ports -viewing angle is average - Screen mirroring is very laggy and causes strain to eye. LG webOS has upper hand here. - Google speech works very very well. It understands indian accent very well",Just about good .. and its cheap,B07HB7SSPZ
"it's just 3 months old, Multiple times it filed to reboot & always asking for the factory reset and when watching tv it is hanging like android mobile when the screencast at that time it stops and never responds . when there is a problem you have to go for the factory reset 99% of the time it is also not working and then you have to power off and on the TV. very bad experience.","Never buy , Stay away ,Very Bad Experience ,, Don't waste your money",B07HB7SSPZ
"As i said its a very basic LED smart tv. I initially thought i will buy this and use as a PC monitor, there are few points you need to note here. This is a basic LED smart tv/android tv. Pros: 1. Good smart features 2. It has built in Bluetooth (good for connecting bluetooth devices/headphones). 3. Display quality is fine, when using as a TV/youtube streamin on TV (as long as the contents are of good quality). 4. Worth for the price 12.4k . cons: 1. Bit of an average display quality (less pixel density) 2. Cant directly use this a an extended/main pc display, unless you have a good graphic card with HDMI (else pixel will fade). 3. it doesnt have the basic sound equalizer (may be its the MI version, it has db's and type of db's you can adjust, its too machine language). Not so user friendly. 4. Sound system/quality is very poor (really sad about it, my phone play good sound than this) . I am using external sound bar. Literally zero bass you get. For any further detailed info of this , you may get in touch with me.",Its a basic LED smart TV. Does its job fine.,B07HB7SSPZ
"MI has done a great job in marketing the fully featured Android TV which is originally manufactured by TCL. But the marketing and customer service after sales by MI provides assurance although this is a very affordabe low entry priced TV in Android market. The setup of this fully featured Android TV is simple and effective and the pre installed apps works flawlessly. Although the video playback through wifi and chromecast even in high speed network had some playback issues in downloaded apps which is negligible if u dont install too many apps. The best part of this MI TV is the remote which is simple and best for Internet TV users. Since its an Android based TV most people who buy this would essentially use more of the Internet content hence this remote which is simliar to Amazon Fire TV Stick is absolutely wonderful. The only thing that needs some improvement is the Sound quality. No doubt that the speakers are loud but the voice clarity is not that clear having used to the other TV brands which cost thrice as much as this MI Android TV. For a start to start using Android fearures in a TV that too in this price segment its easily the best Android TV in the market current if u are willing to spend some money on a quality sound bar for better quality sound. Bought it at a price of Rs. 12,499 without the instant discount on card payment. But if Rs. 1500 is reduced the price of Rs. 10,999 is an absoutele delight for every person who decides to but this TV with all those interesting features provided which works best as promised. Overall a must buy if u are looking for a secondary Android TV or if u are new to the android world. Sure no one would regret for the money paid thanks to Amazon and MI for coming up with this awesome product!",Unbiased Review from a Smart TV user of multiple brands!,B07HB7SSPZ
"MI TV 4C PRO is not Compatible with Dish NXT HD Set Top Box. If you select HDMI input for viewing TV channels, you will not get any Video Output, only Audio will be there. After facing the problem for first time, I thought there is problem in the HDMI cable. I changed that, but the problem remains. Next I called dish tv care, the service engineer tried all settings, finally decided to change the set top box. It was within warranty period, so one new Dish NXT HD box was given. And the same problem arises, only audio out put. That time I was sure that something is wrong with my TV. I contacted MI Care. Service Engineer told me they will change the TV internal board, because USB ports are connected to the board. And finally he changed the TV board. With the new board installed I switched on the TV, selected the HDMI TV input, and surprised, NO Video,only audio. That time the mechanic called another mi technician, he replied this problem is known, it is not compatible with Dish NXT HD set top box. He suggested me to go for any other DTH connection. I have no other option.",Do not buy MI TV 4C PRO if u have DISH NXT Set Top Box: read my story,B07HB7SSPZ
"Very good android tv at the price. No other option in market can beat this quality and features. Pros: Voice Recognition is too good to use Build Quality is very good Sound quality is good at this price and I'm surprised by this Certified Android TV Navigation is easy with remote provided, even remote control is quite good and very simple and clutter free Connectivity is very easy and fast Enough HDMI/USB slots Cons: Hangs a lot when using any installed app Too slow to respond at times, 1GB Ram is not enough. Think of future say after 4-5 years this TV won't even turn-on with this configuration. Patchwall is of no use and all the content either paid or unwatchable. Let buyers decide whether they want amazon prime, netfix, zee5, hungama whatever they can install. Don't bloat. I request Xiaomi to remove the patchwall to make some space and reduce lag. No wall mount stand provided. It's ok if Xiaomi doesn't provide wall mount in package but the wall mount installation guys provide is fixed and non movable. So its of no use. Al least they can provide option fot flexible wall mount. Picture quality is not that great with narrow viewing angles. I have to run it on full brightness always to watch anything on this tv. @8999/- this was my best buy this diwali",No other option. If you're thinking of it you should rather get it.,B07HB7SSPZ
"Mixed experience! did a lot of research before finalising on this TV Reasons I went with this buy 1. Android TV is coming up (again) and TV market is fast evolving, spending 30-40k on a Sony/Samsung as a 5yr investment did not feel right, (this TV could be a temp investment and can upgrade in a couple of years when there are more clearer options) 2. Players like Vu, bpl, sanyo are known for their super bad after sales support; didn't want to take that risk considering MI is marginally better and promising a lot in the service front 3. Even as a standalone tv ignoring the 'smart' aspect, it still is decent value for money at 14k (after 1k cash back) 4. 1yr extended warranty is one more reason to buy now Pros 1. Good picture quality for hd ready (comparable to Sony hd ready) though longevity is a question 2. Speakers are good enough for a mid-sized living room 3. Looks good! 4. Seamless Google account integration Cons 1. Chromecast works only partially - not all apps that support Chromecast cast in this TV, example Netflix 2. Play Store is a joke - hardly 10 apps that are useful available right now and Netflix, Prime, Sony Liv are definitely not on the list Verdict - if you are ready to invest in fire stick (or if you are a fan of PatchWall) then this TV is a decent value for money. Hopefully more apps and features come onboard in this 'android tv'",Decent buy,B07HB7SSPZ

The TV overall is great. One can sideload apps. Switching on and Off takes its time. Bluetooth headphones can be connected which is a useful feature. Sound quality and picture quality is ok. Value for money. Android apps can be side loaded. Amazon messed up with the installation procedure. Sent me the contact details of the installation person who had quit the job 3 minths ago ! Which i feel is a blunder. Du to this installation got delayed. .. Warranty should be considered from the date of installation not date of purchase.,Good TV,B07HB7SSPZ
"Great picture quality,all the features including Google voice search,casting from pc and mobile working ...but fir pc using casing there is a lag,you better use HDMI cable for mirroring, For mobile use Google home application Which supports Chromecast works great. For sound quality I will say 3 stars...because bass effect is not great at all, I will suggest to buy home theater for good sound effects. One problem is that when you connect wireless keyboard and mouse adapter with TV the voice search is not working..... Great product in this price range, must buy",Great product but for sound quality and for bass you should buy home theater,B07HB7SSPZ

"Very disappointed with MI & Amazon. The product is manufactured by TCL not Mi. For this is I could have directly gone for TCL, why I should wait for this and book? This TV is really worst. Not seems like an Android TV & Google play store have very minimal application support. That too required gamepad etc... Netflix & Prime not working. Issues with WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity. Voice remote not working properly and lack of normal remote features for Live TV. Screen and Sound Quality average. Viewing Angle also bad. Our family having more than 5 Redmi brand phones. Assuming the same features and support for this TV but got cheated. Neverever buy this product, installation done on time but after sale support is zero!!",TCL Product not an MI TV,B07HB7SSPZ
It’s a semi smart TV I would say as it doesn’t have Netflix or prime video which are the main Features or a smart TV and the Android tv which is so much promoted - I feel u can’t download all apps so I would give it 1 star as I had bought the earlier version of this so called smart tv and this one too but it lacks majority of smartness which anyone would expect . Please check if the smart tv supports Netflix or amazon prime preloaded before buying any smart or android tv.,Not so Smart,B07HB7SSPZ
"Got it for as low as 9k during sales with discounts. The Amazon installation team didn't show up for 8 days after the TV was delivered. Thankfully we had an option where in we could book an Mi technician for the Mi app. Well I know even teenager can easily setup the TV but if you do it yourself it will void warranty and that is why you have to wait for there technician to arrive who by the way was very quick. Alright let's move to pros and Cons... Pros... 1. Value for money. 2. Looks great and is light weight. 3. It's got both Android as well as Patchwall. And with a strong WiFi connection you won't need Cable or Dish antenna connection any more. 4. For an average room the built in speakers are enough. 5. Patch wall has a lot of free content to offer and when connected to your Android phone there is whole lot of possible things that you can do, being able to play Pub g on medium settings is my favourite. 6. You can connect your pendrive to side load apps as well. 7. trick: Side load thopp TV app to watch paid content for free. 8. Voice command on Mi remote works as good as in any Android phone. Cons.. 1. While the speakers are loud and clear with Android TV apps and Patchwall it somehow seems muffled up with Cable connection. 2. Same applies with display. Normal SD connection cable picture quality is disappointing one needs an HD connection for better experience. 3. WiFi range isnt very powerful had to shift my Mi WiFi router from Bedroom to Hall for a steady connection.","Bang for Bugs, Read review for Pros and Cons",B07HB7SSPZ
So far so good. Delivered on time and installed on time by a very good professional who provided the full demo. About TV : It's worth the price ... I got it for 14k and it's working flawlessly since the day I received it. Suggestion to all is to go through the description and specifications first before buying this rather than buying and then blaming Mi or Amazon for not being upto your standards. They are selling exactly what has been specified. I am happy with what I have got. Plus both Netflix and Amazon Prime can be installed with a workaround easily and they work without hassle.,Worth the prize :),B07HB7SSPZ

Though this TV has Google Play you are not allowed(disabled ) to install amazon prime video and Netflix apps on your TV. 3. This TV not does have autoplay from hdmi / last source option. Which means everytime you open tv it will goto the android homepage and from there you need to select source and start dtv/ cable TV channels. Not at all suitable if you have elder people at home as they will struggle to start DTH channels everytime .

Pros: Decent buy for 15k. Typical android tv with all functions. Picture and sound seems to be pretty much good. Remote is more intelligent and casting facility brings the spirit. All apps just functions like an andriod device. 2 USB slots. Bluetooth facility. Cons: Picture clarity Issues while viewing from sides (color variance and quality issues).

"The Mi TV 4C is just EPIC for the price you pay but the thing is the PlayStore in the Mi TV doesn't have the main apps like Amazon Prime, Netflix and Jio TV These are the 3 mostly used apps but don't know why it doesn't have it Yes you can Side load the apps with the help of .apk files but the thing is it doesn't work like a natively supported app If Mi works towards this there is nothing that can come close to it",The TV is real good but doesn't support a few main apps natively,B07HB7SSPZ
"To start with there are thousands of reviews for the Mi TV, some good and some bad. My review is after using it for a week and I would rate the TV as Average. Like a 7 out of 10. Main reasons: 1. Display quality is average - the blacks are not purely black, the colour suffers a little. 2. WiFi - there are some serious issues with the TV when connected to WiFi, while watching Netflix or youtube, the video plays for some time and then it starts buffering, sort of just gets hung. This can be resolved by using LAN wire instead. Works fine when connected via LAN. My rating keeping in mind what you are getting for the price: Audio - 7/10 Picture - 7/10 Smart features - 8/10 WiFi connectivity - 2/10 Where to buy - Would recommend buying directly from MI website if you want additional warranty at a small cost. Else, go for amazon if you want the option of 10 day replacement incase you face any issues with the TV.",Average TV - Read before buying!,B07HB7SSPZ
"Tv performance is superb, screen and sound quality is good, Google voice control works awesome But I am disappointed with the auto play option, there no option to enable the default HDMI/AV, every time we have to go and choose the input option, when I called to MI customer care they don't know about this and visited nearest MI home even they also don't know about this feature. It will be useless without autoplay option, will get frustrated to select each and every for HDMI/AV. Hope MI will enable this feature in next release.","Happy with the tv performance, expect autoplay play option",B07HB7SSPZ
"It is ultimate option if you donot own a LCD or LED TV till date. If u have one already then its better to buy chrome cast for smart TV functions. Coming to this TV - Great sound, avg pic clarity, decent smart options, built in chrome cast does the job well, no VGA option for PC connectivity but can be connected through HDMA1 port if we have appropriate cable, No bluetooth out but have Headphone out option which may result in low audio output, Google Assist made search option easy with voice facility makes far better than Mi 4A TV.

I’m Loving it. Best smart/Android tv ever in this cheap price tag (13500). If u buy same feature tv of others company u will have to pay minimum 24k (for LG). LG tv is also not smooth as MI. U will love it when u purchase. Sound quality is not too good but it is ok in this price. I have a suggestion for mi that u can also attached Boat speaker or any other good quality Dolby Sounds which sounds like Home theatre and u can also increase price by 1500 more so that customer will get a total quality package.

"This is a OK product. It's basically a bad product, but if you consider the price then you can somewhat justify it. First of all cons are: 1. The screen quality isn't good. The back-lighting is very bad and uneven. 2. Picture quality and colour reproduction isn't good. Most people buy a TV for watching contents but when the panel and picture quality, two of the most important factors aren't good enough, you can't call it a good product. Pros: 1. The sound is very good. 2. Nice design. 3. It runs on Android, it's a huge bonus, and till date I didn't have any lagging issues. - Overall considering the price it's not bad but not good either.",OK product considering the price,B07HB7SSPZ
"Beautiful tv, with loads and loads of features. I am writing this review after 1 and half month. I bought this tv on 8th November. No one can expect the number of features and customization mi has provided in their smart tv which is the cheapest in this market. With the new update there were some more features included. Pros(Things which others have not said): 1) Directly access cable/dish after booting on(New update) 2) Screen off - We can off the screen which takes almost no current and it power on very quickly(New update). 3) We can sideload applications like netflix, amazon prime - etc 4) Easily runs 1080p in youtube without any lag 5) Play games - There are games in the playstore made specifically for this tv. 6) Chromecast - This works like a charm, be it youtube or any other suitable app, casting to this tv is much more easier. 7) Screencast- We can even screencast in this tv, which i had not known before. 8) Mi IR cable to use cable channels using a single remote with some extra features. Cons: 1) Takes about 35s to boot the first time 2) No netflix 3) Still no amazon prime 4) Bundled offer of mi ir cable would have been better This tv is just a good value for money.",Amazing buy of the year!,B07HB7SSPZ

Picture Quality is moderate if you grew up watching Sony TVs. The screen isn't very bright but it does the job. For normal TV viewing, it works fine but takes a hit when it comes to gaming. Sound quality is amazing! 5 stars for that. The TV is both loud and clear. Chromecast- It's inbuilt. Works fine! But still a little shaky. Not the best Chromecast available. Streaming apps like hotstar are affected. Sometimes it won't cast. It just pauses the entire thing. WiFi connectivity is very poor. MI support would ask you to reset it again and again. But that really doesn't solve a hardware problem. For those of you who are looking for a Smart TV, this TV will not give you Netflix and Amazon Prime apps. Since I have a PlayStation so it isn't a problem for me. However, you get Google Play store. Not many apps but would do. The viewing angle isn't that great on this. Overall, this is a decent tv with a lot of features. But these features could use a little work and I'm hoping it would get better with newer versions. 3.5/5","Good buy at price- Ideal for viewing, not gaming",B07HB7SSPZ
"1. TV is good, nice picture and sound quality.Though I moved from Sony to MI, I was not much disappointed as price diff must he considered 2. Installation team was PURE RUDE team (so u have some local store selling same tv with almost price - i will blindly go fr them) 3. I have seen,people saying that they have to select TV as input everytime when they switch on the TV - My suggestion - Please go to setting, there is option to switch on TV from where it was left last as input - enable it 4. Google assistance is awesome (atleast much better than fire stick) 5. Prime and Nexflix not available 6. Remote is actually looks like a Cutie Pie",Good TV but installation team was WORST and RUDE,B07HB7SSPZ
"After 1 week usage i am writing this review. Pros : 1. Pure android 2. Google voice search through remote(95% accuracy) 3. Bluetooth remote .(range of coverage is very good) 4. HDMI 1 has ARC out so what ever the content either through apps or through tv it plays through sound bar . CEC control is there so it can directly control soundbar/ amp volume through tv remote. 5. Set top box STB control through MI IR cable . It can change the channel through TV remote. CONS: 1. NO Dedicated SD card slot as i found in other smart tv 2. PATCHWALL is suitable for hindi language people's no good content for Tamil, Malayalam , kannada. 3. Each time when you want turn on tv it will show as due you want this USB to be used for settop box control? You have to navigate checkbox and click ok. 4.TV audio output is terrible it is playing like a speaker kept inside a pot. use sound bar. 5.picture quality is not that much crispy it is like SD version playing in HD tv. 6. YES Bluetooth is advance then IR but you can't pair tata sky remote with this remote. They should consider both IR and Bluetooth in single remote. 7. Through TV remote if you want to change the channel of settop box means you have to come back to home again launch the tv guide app and play desired channel . So horrible.",Good for something! bad for something ! No one is perfect i mean TV,B07HB7SSPZ
"Product received on 5.10.2019, which date I have given. Installation was to be done on 6.10.19. But nobody has come till 8.00 PM of 09.10.2019.

"This is a good smart TV with lot of features in this range. As per my initial experience Hungama play and Google Cast is not working for me. Kindly provide me a solution. Demo and installation service from HTWAIT is pathetic, first they asked me to get it installed at their suitable time and then on that time called again to give excuse that engineer is not available at that time. After that they scheduled it for another day and on that day also delayed installation by 2-3 hrs. On top of that service engineer charged Rs. 150 for his visit and then when I called the HTWAIT again then he returned that amount and was giving lot of excuses.",Good Product but bad installation service,B07HB7SSPZ
Picture Quality is really poor and sound is pathetic. Its Operating System is really poor. Patchwall is populating all paid stuff. I have to reset OS atleast 15 times since I have purchased. I regret my decision of buying this tv. I suggest not to buy this tv. Its worthless,"worthless, poor quality tv",B07HB7SSPZ
"Display Worst display quality but in this price range bit better Sound Sound quality is also not good. SMART TV Features - NO Netflix, NO Amazon Prime Video. Even using inbuilt Chromecast, we CANNOT cast from Netflix / Amazon Prime Video mobile apps . Installation is very bad I have to call many times to company . But the overall the product is good in this price range",If u have low budget than go for this,B07HB7SSPZ
"Screen mirroring is not supported for all devices even when it's connected to the same WiFi network gets connected but just shows blank screen for few seconds and disconnecs automatically, apps shows installation pending even after cleaning play store data. Need to subscribe for hotstar premium and hungama to view their content directly on TV or else you can screen cast from your mobile.typing on the Keyboard is bit time taking.Not Recommended for Amazon prime users. If not having WiFi network better not buy this.",Screencast problem and app installations,B07HB7SSPZ
"This is a phenomenal TV to buy at this price point. Being an Android TV out-of-the-box, it received the latest and greatest updates right off the bat and Patchwall was updated. To have Netflix and Hotstar installed, you have to wait until the update is finished installing. Also, It used to display 4 stars in few models, and we received a 3-star variant, although the power consumption is still the same, so that's not much of a big deal. The picture quality is mediocre, but you should not expect much, considering we got it for 10,000ish. The TV remote is minimal, but the voice control makes it very intuitive. Mi support centre is pretty quick as well. I was told of a 7-day installation window, but they showed up the very next day. That's fast. Although it asks you not to DIY installation and they won't be accountable for any damage in the process, but we didn't have any problem firing it right on! What I loved about this: 1. Seamless integration with the Android Ecosystem. Just install Google Home and Android Remote and you're all set 2. Clean and simple Android TV out-of-the-box 3. It's absolutely value for money Scope of Improvement: 1. Display Panel can be better 2. Patchwall has a few unnecessary bloats and can be done without 3.",Absolute Delight to watch,B07HB7SSPZ
"I bought this product around 24th Jan. TV looks value for money at this price. We asked the service vendor to provide default wallmount provided MI. But the wall mount is very poor, it doesn't have enough support to hold the TV firm at one place. due to a slight pull when changing cable, TV fall down and LED panel broken. Now there is no warranty for physical damage. Cost of service is equal to TV cost.",Poor Build quality and wall mount quality,B07HB7SSPZ
"ain Smart Features : 1. In-built WiFi Easy to Connect with Home WiFi or Mobile Hotspot. 2. Inbuilt Chromecast Very Easy to mirror Mobile, Laptop, Desktop without internet. 3. Support Android Apps Many Apps like Jio TV not working, but after next update may be it work, Netflix, Hotstar, and Many apps Working Fine. 4. Voice Control Remote Google assistant is just Awesome Very Easy to Control TV using Google Voice. 5. Bluetooth 4.1 Connectivity Can Connect Mobile Laptop Desktop but can't connect BT Speaker or Bluray Home Theatre System, TV Bluetooth only receive, not send audio to other device, for connecting Speaker we need external device which costs 259/- approx. 6.

"Please don't buy mi 4 c pro Led Tv, Because Amazon and mi both not installed your TV correct time. I purchased 12 Oct, and delivered 22 Oct and Till date 30/10/2018 no installation done by Amazon and Mi. So your TV is only show in the box. You don't use this TV. That's why I don't use the TV and no reviews for TV quality. So sorry",Installation process not done by Amazon and Mi.,B07HB7SSPZ
I got the product on 12500 (10% cb on sbi card and 1000 as amazon pay balance) and selling price was 14999. I also got 1 year extended warranty. Delivery and installation was done at the same day. Ordered on 10th Oct and delivered on 12th Oct at around 3 pm. Installation guy came at around 5.30 pm on that day and it took only 30 mins. It was very good to see that kind of fast service. I will not say that this product has best display and sound quality. It has issues like remote gets disconnected and UI lags. But for this price point its value for money product. It will serve your purpose.,Value for money product,B07HB7SSPZ
Android TV is basically for youtube purpose and you can browse in web like movie rulz or any other websites. But don't expect all the android futures as like your mobile works. The app for your mobile android and TV android are different. You will get news apps and online video platform apps only. Games like asphalt and vice city also available. If you are buying it for professional use like video editing or financial and trading don't go for it. Over all ok ok,Android but not fully,B07HB7SSPZ
"Just installed, the picture quality is good. The service person will insist you to buy the tv mount from them, but we can get tv mounts at half the price from amazon. Also, mind he will charge 30 rs for the small AAA size battery to be inserted in the smart remote, thats way more costlier than normal. In regards to TV< awesome picture quality, and ease of navigation. if you are a tech buff, you can install various android apps and play with those. your tv feels like a big mobile at times. But for apple users, you cant mirror the screen or else not even cast the youtube videos. You need an android phone to do that.",Awesome TV for a Home - with all Smart features!,B07HB7SSPZ
"There's NOTHING smart about this TV. Netflix, Amazon primevideo donot work with the TV. Unfortunately, I found this out after purchasing the TV. The interface: The Google TV interface is an absolute pain! Takes a while to boot and every task is time consuming. When the TV is switched on, the home screen opens by default. From there it is required to switch to the desired source. The remote: There isn't a mute button on this remote! Are you kidding me, Xiaomi? Even the source cannot be switched, or the picture settings/brightness cannot be adjusted without going back to the Android home screen! On the plus side, the picture quality isn't bad and Amazon music, Hotstar do work. Definitely would not recommend. Instead, buy a decent non smart LED TV and a Chromecast/fire TV stick to go with.",Disappointed.,B07HB7SSPZ
Superb picture and sound but all android apps in this TV not working in Google play store And most importantly feature is not supported for HDMI Dolby digital and service engineer not a expert Just like road side mechanic untrained student This is not true Android TV.

I bought this TV in Jan 19 waited to write this review because I want to know all feature to this TV now we talk about main thing sound quality super. Display is He ready I played ultra HD video and I was shocked to see this Quality tv can play. RAM is sufficient but for this price it is suitable. Now price of tv is very cheap think like u buyng new mobile but difference is the tv can watch with family. I think sceen mirroring is the best option lot of u think there is no screen mirroring (Miracast) in previous one there was option but this there is no option because it is inbuild u can only connect mi mobile to it. This feature I use for play game mainly PBUG and chess with smart Bluetooth remote with voice recognition well that one is the best option. Because this one Android version so u can use YouTube and other apps,Brand Quality display for Game PUBG,B07HB7SSPZ
"There is no Netflix or Amazon prime on it, there are ways to install it, but then again there are issues. Amazon prime works properly if you install it using aptoide app market. You won't need mouse. But Netflix is harder to install and even if you manage to install it, you will need mouse to play or browse through Netflix. Now if you connect a Wireless mouse adapter, the voice assistant stops working. Anyway I can't complain much.

Previously I was using LG, now I realize in sound quality LG is best. Hope mi will upgrade song software.",Sound quality very poor.,B07HB7SSPZ
Cons: The SD setup box upscaling is not as good as i expected.

All the above options are available on the older model of MI. If you are okay with these drawbacks.. Go ahead for the picture sound and build quality.. Patchwall works fine, it has a Bluetooth remote so you'll need to replace the batteries more often.. 1 star because Amazon did their best to help..",Disappointed with the product..,B07HB7SSPZ
People who came for the installation were dumb and idiots. They firstly charged Rs. 400 for the TV wall bracket which was not informed earlier.

"Mi TV 4c pro is very good TV at this price point. It's an all in one device. Google integration is good & YouTube runs pretty well. Most important thing is, it has Bluetooth remote so bye bye IR & IR related problems & issues. 10x2 watts(20 watt) speakers are very good & very loud. I can hear the audio from the ground floor if I set the volume of the TV at 50%(TV is placed at 1st floor). Patchwall is good os but you need prime or premium subscription for further entertainment if you wanna use those, free subscription on some apps are for 10 days or maximum 30 days. On some apps like hotstar no free subscription you're getting, you must need a premium account to get premium content. That's what I didn't like about patchwall.

"It's been 7 months the TV was working fine, all of a sudden the display went partially black. On raising a request to MI service center, their technician visited and said that its a physical damage which is not covered under warranty, so I'll have to pay ₹ 11,000 for the new panel (i bought this TV for 13k). I asked the technician to explain me how can a tv, which is in such a good condition (you can see I have not even removed the factory plastic) can get spoil. He said something might have fallen on the TV, I said if something has fallen, there must be some marks/ scratches etc. but he wasn't be able to explain.

And Netflix is also not available for MI. So overall it's just a ordinary tv. No smart TV features. When it comes to screen quality.. it's not that great. Pretty average and grainy. But have to give points for a decent sound quality. Installation guy came after 10 days and told us about the fault and asked us to return / repalce it. By that time. Replace window was closed. So after calling customer care 10 times , they returned it. Pls save your money and don't buy this tv.",Worst tv ever. Lots of fault.,B07HB7SSPZ

"After using for 30+ days, here is my HONEST REVIEW. I got the device for 13,512/- with Cashback offers. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mi TV 4C Pro is a budget-friendly TV for the normal user. It does have good specs and is absolutely perfect for its price range. Don't compare it to high-end devices like Sony, Samsung worth 25k+ ₹. ==== 6 SAMPLE PICTURES ARE ADDED ======= Pros:- ===== 1. Patchwall works well. 2. Google play store is available and there are lots of free apps, others you can sideload(NetFlix). 3. Very easy to use simple interface. 4. Colors are very good for the budget. 5. Very smooth UI, no lag or clutter. 6. 1GB RAM + 8GB Storage. 7. Good Sound clarity. 8. Average build quality. 9. Good updates and support. 10. HDMI Ports x3, USB x2, 3.5mm port Built-in Wifi & Bluetooth. 11. Google Voice is really responsive and extremely correct. 12. Play tons of games on the big screen ( multi-player supported) 13. Add External memory ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Cons:- ====== 1. Viewing angles are not the best. 2. There is a bad reflection on the screen. 3. Miracast not supported, unlike the previous models. 4. Screencast(Chromecast) not working properly, most times lags. 4. Remote is Bluetooth and only 7 basic buttons. 5. No built-in support for Netflix(But can be sideloaded), but no Amazon Prime(cannot be sideloaded). 6. Out of 8GB storage only 4.7GB available to the user. Verdict :- ======== Display - 7 / 10 Design - 9 / 10 Sound - 10 / 10 UI - 10/ 10 Connectivity - 8 / 10 ------------------ Overall - 8 / 10 The Mi TV 4C Pro is a great device completely worth the 13,512₹ even with the minor cons. It is perfect gift for yourself and family. I've been using it for 30+ days now and there were no problems till this moment. For people complaining about Amazon Prime, Jio Apps, Netflix please read product descriptions before buying the device. Netflix can be sideloaded, Amazon prime can be watched from Google Chrome browser in TV. Thank you so much for reading my review, Have a nice day.",Worth the money without doubts ..........Honest Review 100%....!! ( See detailed ),B07HB7SSPZ
I didn't like some specific features like.. 1. It was taking almost two minutes to switch on the TV. When i talk to amazon customer care regarding this they said this more enough for this price. 2. We don't have autoplay mode for HDMI/AV that tunes to setup box which already available in 4A model 3. Amazon customer care was very much supportive to MI. They don't understand the problem and even criticizes issues that we are facing. I hope it not customer care it is provider care.,Performance is not great matter for Amazon customer care,B07HB7SSPZ
"I got the package MI tape UNSEALED but the normal taping was done. So I am suspecting it was a returned piece. Leaving that fact. It has good picture quality and overall build is OK. Being an Android tv it don't have all basic apps like Netflix, prime and voot etc on play store which is strange. But can be sideloaded(installed from USB). The software still have glitches but updates might sort it later. screen mirroring is little complicated but I havent got my S8 mirrored yet(tried all ways) No Doubt it is a good TV but has few defects which can be cured by coming updates. Let me say it again- Picture Quality is Good for which i was confused earlier.",Gives more than you pay,B07HB7SSPZ
"Picture quality is decent not best in class i liked it tho Sound quality is good but i use Philips soundbar with that its just awesome Cast sync is great loved it #PUBG player🤘😂 Content is great yea Netflix is not there yet Overall fit n finish is great And people who are complaining about sound quality issue just update it, its great after that. Only delivery was late for me i had to call more then 10 times to customer service. It took 2 days to reach from my nearest hub. That was very bad",Worth your money,B07HB7SSPZ
"After using this TV for a week, below are my observations - Screen is HD (720p) so if you watch from 4-5 feet distsnce, picture quality should be okay - Speakers are not the best I have heard, but does the job. Does not distort at higher volumes. - Takes some time to boot. So if you are used to non-andriod tvs, booting time can seem longer - Remote is bluetooth, so very easy to use. Voice search feature on remote works great.",Value for money,B07HB7SSPZ
"Mirroring experience is horrible. It takes too long to mirror your phone. Even you won't be sure if you could mirror it every time. Even if you manage to mirror it the connection gets disrupted frequently. Say, if you are mirroring a 2hr movie it gets disconnected atleast 3-4 times which is really annoying. After a long mirroring session you'll face lagging on screen. (It is important to mention that I am a hard-core friend of MI and I tried mirroring using note 4, note 5 Pro and 5a) There is no one key navigation to TV mode or default TV mode. Everytime you switch on the TV you'll have to select the source. It is problematic specially if you have senior citizens in your family. Finally the technician who came for the installation couldn't explain things properly citing that he had not been trained at all. So I'm worried whether they could provide proper service in future or not.",Mirroring and TV mode issues.,B07HB7SSPZ
"Great product company that is supported by a Horrible Customer Service Vendor/Team. If you are looking for good support to your purchase, i suggest Samsung or other brands that have established the value of customers than just online purchased and policies that cannot be tweaked. I highly recommend brands that listen to the customer's voice/needs and take steps and amend the policies on a case to case basis.",Awesome Product with Horrible Customer Service,B07HB7SSPZ
"Picture quality is really great.. Also bought one for my office.. I earlier had a tv from local vendor, which was cheap compared to this but when you see both side by side, you'll never by cheap Chinese lcd/led... I really don't care about smart feature, its craze stay less then a weak.. Then every tv is used as normal tv... Picture quality is the only thing that matters.... Go with this tv without thinking twice... Or even better, wait for the sale.. You can get it using credit card in less then 10k...nothing comes close..",Nice product... Worth asking price,B07HB7SSPZ

Typical to mirror/cast phone.) Bluetooth connectivity 5/10. (For Bluetooth connectivity you will have to need pairing. Without pairing any Bluetooth device would not be connect.

"ABOUT THE PRODUCT: Worst ever screen quality and color. The colors in display are washed away and looks like faded and washed. Dont go just behind the brand name ""MI"" bcoz still they r infant to tv market. My life's biggest mistake of buying this tv. About sound its good. Connectivity is good but if i insert pendrive and play movie, tv plays the movie by jumping from time...it cant play the usb contents flawlessly. Regarding youtube connectivity, this tv cant play 1080p videos. Max resolution it can play is 720p. This is not at all fair. About my return: Worst return i have faced in my life with amazon. I placed return by oct 23,2018 and GATI COURIER was expected to pickup within 4 days but due to their laziness and lethargic, GATI COURIER picked the tv by oct 29,2018 at 9:30pm and given acknowledgement slip. The tracking number always shown no data found. I used to call amazon and gati but both of them did not gave positive response. Daily i used to struggle with customer care but those persons only tried to escape by giving fake assurances and cut the call. Then on Nov 7,2018 i called amazon 5 times and after the struggle, they initiated the refund. Approximately i have called amazon more than 30 times to just process refund initiation. Finally amazon have to improve customer service and solve the issue of the customer before the stipulated time not after long time. And also amazon have to cut the service of GATI COURIER bcoz they spoil the amazon's name by their laziness.",Worst screen quality and color reproduction. Worst return service from GATI COURIER.,B07HB7SSPZ
The TV is very good.It has good built in android Operating System.Sound quality is really awesome..I never expected such a good sound.Picture quality is pretty good but not up to the mark. Now coming to the performance overally it is not so fast.MI can fix some of the bugs. The bad thing I noticed was sometimes in the middle WIFI gets disconnected easily and when I am trying to connect it back it is not allowing me to connect instead the entire TV getting hang up.So this is the major issue I was facing which is not at all good.,Features are good worth the money. problem with Network Connectivity and Operating System,B07HB7SSPZ
Good one to go in for. Only problem is though it's not difficult to install you have to wait for services person to come which takestooooooo long. If you open warranty defects not covered. Sometimes problems with USB ports as they don't show up at all and once you restart it comes and works wonderful. Picture quality is very good sound quality is excellent screen quality very good,Good tv,B07HB7SSPZ
"Hi, Are you looking to buy a Tv in Mid-Range? Then this one of should be your choice. Why? Good Picture quality, not the best. But best in the Price range, Even it support 4k. They haven't mentioned but if you are playing 4k content it will run flawlessly without any problem, but it must be in USB. On YouTube, it Can play 1080P Smoothly. As its Wifi Support 2.4Ghz Band Only, not having 5Ghz If It would, Perhaps it would play 4k. Moving to the more specifications, You can read Description all specifications are given and I've personally Experienced as Working Flawlessly. Drawbacks: The Voice of its remote, Like Tik-tik in Every Impression, could make irritation. This Tv doesn't have, A must have apps such as Amazon Prime and Netflix. Tip to Mi- Please work on the Drawbacks to make it superb.",Good One But not The best.,B07HB7SSPZ
"TV though says its smart but it is not even smart as basic mobiles, Last time tv had option of miracast but now it has no such option which is replaced by google cast. This cast requires both mobile which is to be casted and tv, to be connected to some other WiFi, so it requires three devices, where as miracast or mirror share doesn't require such, only u switch on WiFi mode in tv and mobile and you can screen share. Main thing is it doesn't support some good browser at all. It doesn't come with basic apps like amazon prime or netflix, all it has some uselles third party applications in built, why the hell they couldn't has netflix or prime, only god knows. So even if you download google chrome some how, then also u cant watch netflix or prime in browser, its a total waste of money if you think its smart tv in low budget and buy. Its just a trail version and experiment failed product and people bought it in huge numbers, its not completely android just a patch version, only god knows when it will be updated, i bought it in first sale and never got any updates. Ridiculous product, please don't buy now, buy when they release tv with complete android version and able to install all apps in it. Now its just a experiment product.",Useless product,B07HB7SSPZ

This is awsome tv . 32inch is good size and this is working properly. This Tv dont have HDR . But the 43inch Tv has the HDR option. The tv has a Mi-remote which connects with Bluetooth. The Tv can have the mobile apps and can be used for using Internet with Wi-Fi and brodbank connection or ethernet. This is same like android moblile . And it supports google play store and youtube. This can connected with pendrive or phone. Set top box can also be connected,This is good but not better than 43inch,B07HB7SSPZ

"Though the price of TV is very competitive, it is not upto the mark. If you are really on tight budget then only consider this.

"Regret buying poor quality TV, wish I could've spent some more money and bought a branded one. Within 6 month, the TV stopped working totally. Called MI customer care, they sent untrained and unprofessional technician, who assured me that within a week's time, the complaint will be solved. He submitted wrong diagnosis report in thier system and also submitted another report mentioning that the complaint has been solved (which I came to know later when made follow up on my complaint) Week passed, nothing happened then had to call thier CC again. They sent another technician when made regular follow ups, the senior technician visited on 8th day of my complaint, just to see the real problem, he did same thing. Assurance of fixing the problem within a week's time, since they don't have the Motherboard in thier stock. Bottom line: The problem isn't solved on 10th Day of my complaint, third class hardware provided by Mi, which lead the TV stopped working within 6 month. Untrained and unprofessional technician are thier whom they have outsourced the service issues, totally non-cooperative customer service executive. Totally waste",Total waste,B07HB7SSPZ

Really amazing in this price range with ample of feature to entertain. Patch wall and android combo is superb. I'm enjoying the interface. I recommend everyone to go with it. This is the best TV in this price range... Service of MI is also very good. Contacting them is a issue but better part is that they contact u back once you drop request on their portal.

"It's an amazing product with Smart TV features, built in Chromecast, great! about sound quality, its loud but isn't crisp and clear, it's just loud. Wall mounting is pain in the butt since it doesn't come with wall mounting screws and bracket. Display, it's 720p not much to say. Overall good TV for this price range although i wish it was 1080p least. For the overall TV quality and what i brings to the table for this price, wouldn't mind paying tiny bit extra for 1080p.",Amazing product! Still 720p though,B07HB7SSPZ
I've started watching tv a lot after getting this (maybe that's a bad thing ;)) But i absolutely love the HD quality and it's a pleasure to watch movies/television and what not..

Mi Smart Tv is a value for money product. Previously I was using Philips led tv which we used for almost 4 years. As of now quite satisfied with Mi Tv experience.

"Actually, I wouldn't say that Amazon is cheating... However the product is not upto the mark the way it is being advertised 1.

Somewhat i feel i got cheated on the display quality by MI 2. Sound is just fine. 3. Voice control is fine, but that remote without regular button takes lot of time to switch over to chennal/program 4. Installation was on time.

I have been told by the engineer that the panel inside has broken and this is not covered under warranty. I purchased in 11,000/- and the cost of replacing the panel would be 9,000/-.

Picture quality is not that great thus we cannot expect more from a 720p panel but i think it should be atleast 1080p. Screen is bright enough but at night it irritates our eyes when complete white screen apears. The backbone of this tv is its interface which is the fastest i believe under 30k tvs. You won't feel any lag while navigating the keys. Fast internet is must for this tv to get the 100% potential of it. I believe at least 5 mbps or more. 4k playback is smooth like a butter not a single lag.,Good tv in budget section!!!!,B07HB7SSPZ

We can't ever download google chrome. It has a Android Playstore support, but it doesn't help in downloading / accessing any of these popular Apps. It was a bad decision to buy from me.

I use screen saver for wall decorations also that look amazing of my family pictures. All these are +ve points. Let's talk about -ve points, this is not fully Android TV you can not install prime video, Netflix Airtel tv etc. But you can screencast them from your mobile.

And on other side MI is a big brand but to compete in market they are providing poor quality and just focusing on more features but built quality is worst.,"Poor screen brightness and colours Vu , marq, are more better options",B07HB7SSPZ
"The picture quality is bad due to lack of uniformity and appears similar to a wall on which paint has been applied in an uneven coating. The bluetooth of the TV does not function well and the output sounds as if the bluetooth speaker is suffering from sore throat. When I called Mi TV service centre, they heard the problem and then refused to help. I then returned the product on Amazon as this was really a bad deal. It is not a bad bargain if someone wants a TV that cheap, but it is really a cheap product and one must spend some more money and buy a TV from some other brands like Samsung, LG etc.","Had there been zero star, I would have given zero stars",B07HB7SSPZ
I've used this tv for a month. This is a good buy in this price range. Picture quality is not so good but fine in this price range. Sound is quite loud.

Good TV with this price but there are some bugs with MI. You cannot transfer files (apk. not in play store). The worst part is installation of this TV.

I don’t understand y do we even need to book the installation, it should come with the television by default. That was a very bad experience Amazon... About the TV- it’s the best that you can get in this price range. However there the screen always shows your shadow and the speakers are not that good.

"If you want to buy this TV spend a few minutes to get a detailed review about this TV from my usage. After examining all the review videos available in youtube and reviews in the review section I bought this TV. I bought this TV for 13,498 which I got a discount by paying through SBI debit card. And let's discuss about the TV PROP'S > This TV has a adorable picture clarity which is best for this price range it can highly support 720p resolution. > The sound clarity is very extreme it delivers a high range sound even bass is very good when standed. > It has updated 8.0 Android version with all upgraded apps like YouTube , Google search etc. > TV has enabled voice search feature which runs quite decent. And the Bluetooth remote is the best thing as you can use it from anywhere with out sitting behind the TV. > It doesn't even require a stabilizer but using one is a good task. CONS • There are no major defects that can be said about this TV but some major issues that I found are: * The TV gives a little noticable lag while shuffiting between apps. * And even cast screening is a big task to connect at first I can easily casted my screen but now it is not getting cast screen I don't know why. * And when I used Bluetooth mouse in the TV it responds slowly compared to PC's as I don't know Android may not give a good mouse optimization. * Consumes lot of data when connected through hotstop or Ethernet. * TV comes with complete plastic body and metal parts are available even the stands are made of high grade plastic (but this is not a high end concern it give a best experience) When I compared this TV to it's older versions of 4a (32""),(43"") they don't have a updated android versions and YouTube will support a highest video resolution of 720p but in this TV it will even support 2160p (4K) happy for this feature Overall this is best TV for the people who think to have a smart TV in low affordable price this is the best choice. Even we have VU, Thompson, and other branded TV sellers which cost a bit higher than this TV As MI is a trusted company as we know that so everyone can happily buy this TV without any concern as there are no major issues with the TV",Value for every penny you invest.,B07HB7SSPZ
"Pros: For this price- nice picture, good sound, not much vibrant colors except some over makeup channels like ""colors"" Online streaming was good, viewing angle not bad, Voice search and google assistant was nice, Delivery, installation and demo was good and in time. Cons: Body panels are Not fitted properly i have attached the picture to see but this is not a big issue human errors will occur In some videos the sound are not supporting but we can use the app MX player like that viewing angle 170 degree it shows more contrast but i watch in straight so this is a con who are watching in 170 degree Pros in one line : This is nice one Cons in one line : Nothing we can do perfect 100%","Nice product to buy in this cost, But the body panel was not fitted properly",B07HB7SSPZ

Patchwall does a descent job if you have no previous benchmark. It was easier for to adapt. Picture, sound quality is good for a small room. Streams content beautifully. Overall a good experience.

Loading time for content could be a faster.(could depend on Internet connection too..,slow for a 12mps connection).",Good piece of work MI......,B07HB7SSPZ

I can play 720P quality videos without any lags. Its pretty good and the experience is awesome. The only drawback i felt was, the installation service provided by Amazon. I received the TV on Nov 2nd and the installation service executive told that slot is available only on Nov 8th. I don't know why would they need 6 days. Luckily installation wasn't hard and i did it myself I would recommend Amazon to change the installation service partner because I could see lot of complaints about the installation.",Expectation Satisified,B07HB7SSPZ

I was particularly impressed with the sound this tv pump out, in normal use i was only using it with around 25 % of sound level. Though both speaker are down firing and i would have preferred front firing. Built quality felt decent. The only problem i had was that its while using it with casting it got hang with picture but sound continued to move other then that i felt it to be best worth for money tv out there in the market.",Best value for money.,B07HB7SSPZ

The only thing I miss in this tv is jio app , Netflix etc apps not in its playstore have to install via pendrive that works but it will be great if they r provided by mi playstore itself Otherwise pictures quality, sound, connectivity, smart features, tv remote etc are really appreciable I strongly recommend to everyone on behalf of my 7 months experience with mi led tv 4c pro 32 to buy it Great experience",Strongly recommended for everyone. Overall all give 4.8 rating stars to the tv. Apps like jio,B07HB7SSPZ
"The TV was delivered on time and the installation person came the next day on time. I will cover what others haven't - I have checked casting from Mi Redmi Note - works flawlessly. Once you connect to same network, cast button appears. You can also cast mobile screen. The Google voice assistance too works flawlessly. However when I try opening Hotstar, it says can't understand. All other general commands like what is weather like etc works. Sound is loud and clear. Apps in appstore are very less and pretty much useless as of now. Hope to get Amazon TV at least in future. I have used the TV the whole day and wifi works without problem. Frankly, I was relieved that online purchase turned out to be good so far.","Excellent performance .Sound good, and no wifi problem",B07HB7SSPZ

Now Mi TV is not working .I have registered my compliant however I did not get response so far from mi side that is a terrible experience which I felt .so friends think before buy this cheap and low quality mi tv otherwise you will cry after buy this product.,Terrible and low quality product ( don't buy),B07HB7SSPZ
"Pros. 1. Good picture, sound quality, 2. Really smart as it has Android OS 3. It has voice search assistant through remote. 3 Almost everything is good other than mentioned below Cons.. 1. Sometimes I feel brightness and contrast is on higher side. 2. When you cast your mobile it hangs after some minutes approx 15 min.",Worth to buy. Awesome,B07HB7SSPZ
"Satisfied with Amazon services and mi brand but the service engineer who was came to home, even he doesn't know the proper installation and demo of the TV. Simply he is giving the blind reasons for the settop box is not working, remote is not working like.. Even though the wallmount installation is not done properly.. Obviously mi needs to send a qulified service engineers to install a TV and demo for the customers.",Overall the TV is very good with this cost..,B07HB7SSPZ
"I already own a 43"" model of MI which does not have Bluetooth. But this pro series has Bluetooth. I mostly prefer using my Bluetooth headphone with MI TV which I like about this TV. It has Google play store with only TV compatible apps, otherwise apps can be installed via USB. Picture quality is little disappointing but still we cannot expect much quality from a 720p TV. My other 43"" MI TV's picture quality is great in which I cannot spot any pixels. But with this TV pixels are clearly visible sometimes. I will recommend 1080p or higher models of MI TVs. But under 15k , it's totally worth it. I got this one for 14k on 1st Jan2019. Also I'll be using this TV only for watching movies and series. This TV supports my 2TB Seagate harddrive. Sometimes the default media player will not support audio while watching movies, but then I installed VLC player which fixed this issue. Impressed by its features at this price tag.",Bluetooth feature is great for private listening!,B07HB7SSPZ
"For this price range, product is just off the charts. I would recommend it to anybody. Decent looking, thin, weightless. Played videos up to 4k, plays it smooth. Couldn't be happier.

Amazon lists this as a smart TV fully knowing that half of the apps don't work....expect the customer to read the description but why fool people by listing it as a smart TV when as on date it is not fully functional with all features...this is unfair trade practice and misguiding...hoping someone will miss the description and be fooled...,Deliberate Incorrect listing from Amazon.,B07HB7SSPZ
"It is very cheap in market rates & very high qaulity in this price range. Full paisa vasool chiz hai, sound, display, networking, voice search is awesome, overall everything is great.

"Just got this one delivered and installed the same day and it is fantastic! Recently, I discarded my samsung 32"" smart tv with nearly same specs but this one is way SMARTER than samsung and with patchwall+oreo, it multiplies the user experience! sound quality is better as compared to samsung and picture quality is somewhat same. Although, one thing I am missing is direct screen cast(Samsung TV had an input option as screen mirroring) .There is no such option yet but an update and I will check whether screen cast is available or not after the update. I can use the built-in chromecast , but it requires both devices to be on same network with internet connectivity (WiFi) and I discontinued my WiFi due to some reasons. Also, there is no option to set AV or HDMI input as default, i.e. You have to select AV each time you want to watch TV, which is absolutely no problem to me, but it disturbs my parents, but they will cope up. Rest, everything is fine and I got this for 12,500 (1500 instant discount+1000 rs. cashback) . This is a must buy SMART TV. There are some tips: > Do not open the box yourself (wait for technician otherwise if anything happens, you are responsible) > If you opted for wall mount, do not pay a penny more than 400 > Visit the website provided for installation request and contact the xiaomi customer care number if you need any help. > Buy battery beforehand as they are not provided in TV I will update this review after some time.",Just go for it!!,B07HB7SSPZ

# Delivery by amazon is not nice.installion team not come by scheduled time. # Mi tv 4c pro value for money @15k.but i bought it in amazon sale for 12.5k. # Picture quality is good in online streaming.but suffer slightly at SD setupbox. # Sound is loud and not the best in clarity. # Screen display quality is not good.still we can see some washed out whites when booting. # Google os and patchwall os on 1gb ram.good but struggle some times. # Wifi issue is series.if wifi disconnect while using then it makes while tv hang until your restart. # mi tv remote not working some time.when tv hang and struggle. # Patch wall content one of the best try but simply frustrating bcoz all things need sign up and subscription to watch content.they say morethan half of the content is free but thats not true. # Installation team not tell anything clearly about repair and service within period of warranty. #overall if mi fix's bugs via update then it's all fine.good android tv from mi.you can give a try.,# Worst delivery by amazon. # mi tv 4c pro best value for money.,B07HB7SSPZ

"NOTE: @ If you select brand-authorized TV installation, then DO NOT unbox the tv until MI representative arrives. This ensures, that if TV is damaged in transportation, then you will get replacement easily. @ If you didn't choose installation, then just SHOOT the video of unboxing by yourself, to avoid any hassle in case replacement is needed. @ Amazon Prime and Netflix are not inbuilt, but can be Side-loaded !!! @ To use your Set top box with android interface, you need to buy MI IR cable and set it up. * OR else directly connect the set up box via AV or HDMI port, to use it conventionally. @ Out of 8GB memory, you only get around 4.7GB free to use (check the image attached) There are Hundreds of review on this TV here as well as on youtube, but NONE explains the TV's potential completely and what its actual flaws are. Here's a quick Fact for the User's complaining about the LESS cost to benefits ratio, guys if you buy a Android TV box alone which has processing capacity similar to this tv, then it would alone cost you more than 5K rupees & here you get this TV with that android setup with various other feature under 15K. So just check once, what options you have before complaining. Eventually I bought this TV, since I was already using 4A 43 version for months and wanted smaller version for bedroom. Now after using this TV for over 3 weeks, I am stating my DETAILED user experience. Its a detailed & huge review, but do read it, if you want to invest this much amount. ●● If you want to get quick overview of the device, then read below else scroll down for Detailed Review ●● # Firstly its budget friendly & ONLY Smart TV under 15k in the current market. # Has Most number of Output port ( 1*AV, 3*HDMI, 2*USB ). # Has Android 8.1 out of the box along with inbuilt Bluetooth # Has Dual interface - MI Patchwall & Android TV ( I mostly prefer android TV interface ) # Remote has Bluetooth & Voice Search with sleek profile. # Has better processor compared to predecessor along with 1GB RAM + 8GB storage ( 4.7GB actual ) # Speaker Output is low. # Need IR cable for using set top box with android interface. # Amazon prime & Netflix is NOT preloaded, but can be side loaded. # Native Display is ONLY HD, though 1080p & even 4K videos from youtube works well (check images attached). # Can install & play tons of High quality games like RR3, etc (check images attached). # Finally smartphone mirroring works fine most of the time. FULL DETAILED REVIEW :----> BUILT QUALITY : ------------------ # Has combination of plastic and aluminium for the main body. Its not great, but above average. # Table top stands looks bit flimsy, but are workable. * The screws which are provided in the box, DOES NOT fits the tv perfectly, so I bought new from local store. # It has averagely slim profile, not the slimmest in the market. # Speaker Placement is inconvenient. Since they are placed at the bottom, so when you keep it on table top, the sound tends to dampen and bulge. # Has good ventilation for electronics and it hardly heats up. # Overall built quality is above average. DISPLAY QUALITY : --------------------- # It has very Thin bezels, which looks great. # Video resolution is 1366x768p, but 1080p videos works fine on it. * 4K videos on youtube runs smoothly as well. # Viewing angle are good compared to price. ( Check the images attached ) # Contrast is above average, Brightness is good and colours are quite vivid. # Display quality is also above average, not very great. REMOTE CONTROL : ----------------------- # Its very sleek and compact. # Has only 7 buttons and is easy to operate. # Fortunately it has Volume buttons, which is handy. ( I have couple of android TV boxes without volume button on remote, so I know the pain of using mouse to adjust the volume :P ) # Placement of Voice search button is improper. Its just below Power button, and I end up pressing power button a lot. # Finally its bluetooth, so no need to point it towards tv for operation. OTHER FEATURES : --------------------- # It has Dual interface, i.e. Patchwall and android TV. Has tons of content. # Many games can be installed (till you have memory left), including multiplayer games. # Google voice search is very useful, if you don't want to use keyboard. # Processing speed is fast and I haven't detected any lags yet. ( Lags in streaming can be due to slow internet speed, not due to hardware ) # Bluetooth and wifi connectivity works perfectly. CONS : ------ # Speaker output though rated 20W, is NOT upto the mark. My 16W JBL speakers has better and louder sound. # Placement of speaker is inconvenient, as in table top position, speakers face the table and sound dampens. # Internal Memory is very LESS. # NO Netflix and amazon prime pre loaded, though you can side load them. # Miracast not supported. Even normal smartphone mirroring lags sometimes. # Native resolution is just 720p HD, though the 1080p videos works on usb & 4K on youtube. # Screen is Slightly reflective, its similar to almost all the other LED tv's. # Mixed experiences of after sales service. CUSTOMER CARE : -------------------- # Firstly the installation is a Joke. My installation was scheduled 16 days after my product Delivery and the fun part is, there's ONLY 10 days replacement window for this product :P # Company only takes replacement if the product is opened by their Representative, so there's NO point of return window time frame. # MI has mixed reviews for repairs and services. Though I have not encountered any problem with any MI tv yet, I have had issues with other mi products and service center near me is always very helpful. VERDICT : ----------- Considering all the facts, if you are fine with above average Display quality, want a Smart tv and if you have tight budget, then this the TV you should certainly go for. Trust me, you won't get any better deal than this least for coming couple of months. If you have higher budget, then certainly explore brands like sony, samsung, etc. This is NOT a perfect smart TV, but for the given price and 2 Years of warranty, its NO brainer to choose this, its certainly worth the investment.",DETAILED REVIEW after 3 WEEKS of Usage !!!,B07HB7SSPZ

I have not tested its USB ports since my sole purpose is to use it as a normal TV. Installation:- Is taken care by eAirtec itself so no need to call Amazon. Once you receive the product call their customer support number at 18001024877. Installation was done by Jeeves (think eAirtec installation partner) within 24 hours after the call. Final verdict :- I am fully satisfied with the purchase. If you don't have deep pocket and are willing to give a chance to lesser known brand, you can go for eAirtec.",Good buy.,B07MGQS2M8

"I contemplated buying one of those cheap Chinese brand first but I had heard so many horror stories from friends about the poor quality and limited service availability, that i eventually went for a premium product. I have a lot of products from Samsung at home and I am very happy with them so I went for Samsung. Sharing my observations from using it for a few days: - The TV was delivered and installed on time without any follow ups. - It is a top notch premium Iooking UHD TV with sharp pictures and good brightness. Clearly, Samsung picture quality cannot be replicated by Chinese TVs. - The sound is loud enough for my room size and vocals clarity is awesome. It has dolby digital. I used the Tune Station app once-it allows me to play music while the TV screen is off. - I sometimes pair my phone with the TV. Screen mirroring works smoothly without any lag. It also has a live cast function which I used once and it worked like a dream. - Another thing that stands out (and is missing in TVs like MiTV) is the pre-built VoD apps such as Netflix, Prime, Hotstar, Zee 5 etc. - The TV is extremely easy to control. Its interface is clutter free. I could easily navigate through the TV menus from the first time I switched it on. - Overall, a wonderful TV at this price. Strongly recommended!","Amazing product, highly recommend!!!",B07NSLTQH6
"Brought the tv at 49,999. Incredible clarity, color and picture quality. Ticks a lot of boxes and carries an tempting price tag. Pros: Excellent motion handling Very good HDR performance 20w dolby digital audio Cons: Doesn't have Bluetooth connectivity",The best 4k tv of 2019,B07NSLTQH6
"Hardly used this TV for 3 months. it stopped working. When called technician from samsung, he is suggesting not to buy TV from Amazon. When asked for replacement, they are saying we cant. When asked samsung customer care to give in writing that they cant replace faulty piece. They are plainly saying 'No we won't' Do not buy this model. Customer service of samsung is aweful. After spending 50k on a TV, i am left with worst experience ever on amazon.",Sub-standard product--- DO NOT BUY THIS FAULTY MODEL,B07NSLTQH6
"Bought this on 16th June and on 10th July ( less than a month) the HDMI1 port stopped working. Now running around and Samsung people come, check and then keep taking time to send someone else. Now talking about changing motherboard. This is the quality Samsung gives that in less than a month a TV gets spoilt and it's like now having a second hand TV. Won't do a replacement which ethically should be done My suggestion is not to buy this!",Defective pc recd,B07NSLTQH6
Picture quality amazing 720P + videos looks flawlwss Sound is ok ok. on my Sony tv was better Now thing to consider Remote is seriously old style. No bluetooth so can not use any other. Buttons are closaly placed so its very hard to use Smart feature is almose useless becouse of remote. If you plane to use it with mi box or firestik go for it otherwise as smart tv ? Not worth.,Remote downplayed otherwise fantastic TV,B07NSLTQH6
"Got this UHD tv for 50k. At this price point I would say it’s a sweet deal. Coming to the features it’s packed to the brim. Picture clarity, sound quality is excellent. Only thing I dislike is the remote which is not smart. Also it doesn’t have Bluetooth which is a letdown by Samsung",Go for it !,B07NSLTQH6
"The picture quality is really good but lacks right amount of refresh rate for playing UHD videos, although it is a UHD certified 4K TV. The sound output is nice but amplification at some instances is required for appropriate audibility. The TV goes into loop startup sometimes where it won't start even if you keep pushing the power button, this problem seemed to resolve by it's own if you wait for few more seconds. I'm not sure whether it happened with the others but I get screen blink (during loop) after pushing the power button just like when the TV was trying to power up it's display but the power cuts off. Hope the review helps others. Thanks for spending your time reading this.","It doesn't come with the conventional AV IN slots, please consider it before you buy.",B07NSLTQH6

"Should be very careful before ordering as it does not support wireless 5G and also Voot and other app cant be downloaded. It's not android OS, for most app to work you need to buy amazon stick extra. Be very careful. Tried to return but was not successful as they dont entertain these reason or case. Read return policy term very carefully before ordering Samsung TV from Amazon.",Not support most of android support. No return,B07NSLTQH6
"I was looking to purchase UHD TV for so long. And surprisingly Samsung launches UHD models in beginning of March 2019. And I felt lucky that time that I waited for right product. This is hands down the best model in market (at price of Rs 49,999 for 50 inch model).",Great UHD TV by any company so far,B07NSLTQH6
Not able to install jio TV app,Software installation issue,B07NSLTQH6
Samsung should have marketed a better remote control for this TV which is disappointing. Also 3D picture support missing in this TV which is a shortage feature in this price range. Better buy other brands in this range,Smart features not up to mark,B07NSLTQH6
This product should be supporting Bluetooth but there is no option of Bluetooth? Secondly where is the 60k + movies as claimed. The Non-HD channels are very low quality!!!,Feedback,B07NSLTQH6
"Reviewing the UA50NU6100 50 inch 4k smart led tv after 12 days. Awesome 4k led smart 50 inch tv with in the budget models from samsung. It has pur colour technology, which shows rich colours. It has good black level contrast which produces real blacks, as it uses back led light(direct led technology) which will be always on and off on the necessity of the light for the picture. It has good bright levels. Sound is great as it has Dolby digital plus. Uhd dimming is good. It has HDR 10+. Tizen OS with Apps like amazon prime video,Netflix,YouTube, Hot star, jio etc. Wifi works fine and also it has screen mirroring,chromecast,live-cast(exclusive in samsung 4k led tv's) etc. (1 Optical cable port,1 terrestrial port, 2 hdmi port and 1 usb port. ) Picture quality 9.5/10. Sound quality 10/10. Smart features 10/10. Samsung Service 9/10. Con's Bluetooth is absent. Only 2 hdmi port. (1 arc , 1 video). Only 1 USB port. Ordinary type Remote.",Excellent 4k led smart tv among the budget models,B07NSLTQH6
"Just installed it yesterday, so far I'm loving it. Just few heartbreakers 1) Remote is basic, nothing smart. No voice control. 2) Voice cracked a bit on high volume while using cast. I was using Amazon music app on phone and casted it to TV. So noticed a little cracking. And even some volume fading. But on Gaana app installed in TV , music worked fairly good. 3) Screen was not filling in Hotstar and Netflix... although did fill full screen while watching YouTube videos. 4) More apps would be welcome as im still not sure I should discard my FireStick or not. Apart from these sore points I'm happy with my purchase. Special thanks to Amazon for the speedy delivery as Flipkart had disappointed me for the same and they returned TV midway and later blamed me that I cancelled the order, which I never did. They requested me to cancel saying they can't deliver. Still i dint cancel.",Thanks Amazon for speedy delivery. Great purchase.,B07NSLTQH6
"Terrible experience! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT AND DEFINITELY NOT FROM THIS SELLER! I got this product today, at first was beautiful now I noticed backlight bleeding all over the screen. I tried to replace the product but they transferred my call to a so called tech person who does not even know what backlight bleeding is. I tried explaining the problem and he was like they will send a tech person for inspection after two days and send a report and then decide what to do. Pathetic service from Amazon.",DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! Definitely not from this seller,B07NSLTQH6
"For this price tag, Sound quality, Video quality & Smart features are good enough. It would have been nice if smart remote is part of the package. Frame is small thereby good screen to body ratio. Haslefree connectivity to internet. There is a shortage of HDMI port. There are only 2. Nowadays people connect gaming consoles, Sound bar, dish connections or Streaming devices. 2 would not be sufficient for many users.",Worth for the price tag,B07NSLTQH6
One of the finest quality picture with 4K UHD TV. Keep it up!,Excellent Product!,B07NSLTQH6
"I would have given it five star except for the sound which is a little bit of a disappointment when I compare it with my older Sony model. When it was installed, the sound seemed a little too bass, it reverberated and sometimes it was difficult to make out the dialog. I was about to invest in a Bluetooth speaker which would have been expensive since this model has only a optical out and would have needed an optical to Bluetooth converter. But fortunately, the problem was solved adequately by setting the equalizer. I reduced the lower two frequencies by two notches and the sound became much clearer. But it is still just a little bit behind the Sony. Everything else is great. Picture Quality is superb and USB playback works for all the formats I tried. WiFi works nicely. Installation was smooth and professional and the latest wall mount quality and simplicity was good. One cannot expect more at this price; A Samsung Brand TV backed by Samsung name and support.",Excellent Values for Money,B07NSLTQH6

"Defective piece was delivered to me. The features of wireless display from Laptop or Mobile phone is not working properly. My HP laptop is not all able to connect to the TV. Also if I connect my mobile phone, it gets connected but then after 5-10 mins it gets automatically disconnected . The Samsung Technical engineer said that Samsung TV many times does not connect to a HP laptop(I have a brand new HP laptop) through a wireless display feature. The engineer had no answer of why mobile phone is getting disconnect . He tested with his own mobile phone and even that was getting disconnected.",Defective piece,B07NSLTQH6
"I got TV and I requested service support . They allocated a person and sent me his phone number. I called him in morning, he told me he will come soon.

After I told him everything he told now only I got your job order I will visit after two days.",Worst service support by Samsung,B07NSLTQH6

No Bluetooth No Aux output No audio out put only HDMI output Optical audio output available Pic quality ok Screen mirror super Try to buy on sbi card for low money,I like pic quality,B07NSLTQH6
"Bought this in 2019’s Great India Festival. Switching from a 32 inch Vu LED Tv, the experience has been great. Ultra HD 4K TV, that too from Samsung, stands out in picture clarity. Another huge plus is Samsung’s sound quality which you’ll never get from cheaper Chinese/Indian counterparts, although one drawback is the missing dolby config. Picture is great, but a refresh rate of 60 Hz is noticeable when things move fast. But then again, all the TVs in this range come at this frequency. Remote is with a lot of unnecessary keys. I’m still fine with it, but my parents find a hard time trying to find online content like Netflix. To sum up, pros outweigh the cons and, yes, it’s a good call to pick this instead of a 30K Vu TV or an Mi TV.",Good buy at the price,B07NSLTQH6

"What works: Best in class display Great pair of speakers Responsive UI Supports all the major streaming services What doesn’t: Voice input is absent Standard, old-school remote No proper Google Cast alternative No India-specific features like Patchwall The Samsung NU6100’s most striking attribute is its 43-inch screen which goes nearly edge-to-edge. The bezels especially disappear when you’re watching a dark-themed piece of content such as Stranger Things on Netflix.

Thanks Amazon & Samsung.",SAMSUNG means Perfection. Love it!,B07NSLTQH6
"A pathetic product from Samsung. Sound completely goes blank at times, even after replacing the motherboard the issue persists. This is the case when under warranty, only god knows what would happen when the warranty expires. It is better to purchase a TV from some other lesser known brand as the price would be lot lesser.

Bang for the buck. Average TV user cannot make out difference between what this offers at this price and higher priced higher spec TV s. Point is we are watching content which itself is not 4k or that high resolution 99% of time. So as long as it can play 4k it's the max you need. Rest depends on budget.,Best TV for the price,B07NSLTQH6

Best in Class Display type LED VERY Best Picture Sounds Amazing 4k Performance Excellent Connecting Fast and very easily but Really 4K,Brilliant Samsung Super 6 Ultra HD 4K,B07NSLTQH6
"This is the first smart TV I have ever ordered. From a layman's point of view, the picture quality is brilliant, even for a 4K resolution, along with the sound which is fantastic. For those who were expecting a smart remote are in for a disappointment. Moreover, the playback and rendering is smooth and without a glitch. Most of the TV apps are available like Netflix, Zee5, Hotstar, Jio Cinema, Amazon Prime, Hooq, Sony Liv etc., but don't expect a Google Playstore as it is not an Android TV. The TV apps are optimised for a comfortable streaming and Netflix works the best. As far as inputs are concerned, there are 2 HDMI ports, 2 USB ports, and a 3.5 mm AUX output. If you don't have an HD set top box, then you may have to get one. Sound is the key takeaway and you won't need an additional speaker or soundbar for sure.",Good for a start,B07NSLTQH6
Awesome product by Samsung. value for money also. Product mentions true 4K. I am a Samsung user for many years. Very reliable products.,Quality product at great value,B07NSLTQH6

"I bought this TV through Amazon on 4th October 2019. In one month started facing issues where the TV gets switched off on it's own and the power light keeps blinking. Lodged a complaint at the Samsung helpline and they arranged for a technician to check the fault. The technician is stating that the fault is with the mother board which needs to be changed. Hardly a month and fault with the mother board? I have asked for a replacement. But really losing faith in Samsung products. Horrible experience, think twice before you go for this product.",TV is getting switched off and not able to switch it on,B07NSLTQH6
"Got a defective one first time.. it wasn't starting on first press of remote button.. taking 8-10 minutes to on.. registered complaint for same and Samsung had to replace mother board... So ultimately, new TV had to get repaired so it was really a bad experience.. but now it's working totally fine after that",Not great for sure,B07NSLTQH6
"What's worse than the reliability of this tv is Samsung's service. After multiple calls to them, the only thing they are consistent with is reiterating that if the product is faulty it's not their fault. It's their policy. If it works good for you and if on doesn't buy another tb because Samsung won't be helping you. Defeats the purpose of buying a Samsung product. Final verdict. Don't buy this tv if you're looking at long term use.",Samsung's not what it used to be. Stick to budget tvs. Easily replaceable.,B07NSLTQH6
"Product is amazing, perfect picture clarity, easy function, very happy with the Samsung Technician who did the job on right time and with perfection. Only challenge is sound quality not that great",Great product by Samsung by loyal customer since 2008,B07NSLTQH6
"Where is app download option, frustrating and what old model remote is given. Even the three year warranty given on Facebook tv looks wrong, Amazon representative don't have any clue of that. I recommend not to buy this tv instead buy any normal non smart TV and use fire stick. Anyways we have to use fire stick. Upset with this product","App download options not there, waste",B07NSLTQH6

"Bought my sony bravia tv in the great indian festival with some discounts and a two year special screen warranty benefit. My review is for the common people who wants to enjoy 1080i HD quality with DD+ sounds at home without paying money to the theatres ☺️ I always wanted to watch movies in 1080i hd because now a days the TV channels r HD and I downloaded a lot of movies from torrents in 1080i but couldn't see this pic quality as I had only 720i HD ready monitor 😒 Don't be fooled by the word HD READY cus those r only 720i and not gives u 1080i! This TV has TRUE 1080i resolution with true DD+ sound effects with 30w output. This is the most affordable bravia in 30k range. Other brands do manufacture smart TVs at low price but u can't have this quality sounds and picture in those TVs.About the delivery,it was really nice and the TV installer came and mounted my TV in wall with zero cost. But one thing , AMAZON BUYERS, IF U BUY ANY SONY PRODUCT FROM AMAZON ALWAYS LOOK FOR ONLY TWO SELLER : CLOUDTAIL & APPARIO . Because only these r Sony authorized dealer. Sony provides full support for these two sellers . I have found this thing only on their website. My seller was CLOUDTAIL. It's total value for money and hope not to buy a TV for at least a decade 😀",The Best FULL HD LED TV for middle class common people like us !,B07QB77C92

"I was looking for 32 inch smart tv for 1 month & after good research I finally came across this one. Although the price is a bit higher from other brands, the quality of tv is exceptionally good. I shortlisted some options & experienced them at stores & trust me I was blown away by Sony’s quality. The picture & sound output was just unmatchable if you compare them with other brands eye to eye. I decided to buy it from Amazon as it came for 32K. delivery was super quick. Kudos to Amazon! I’ve been using this TV daily & I’m very happy that I bought it. The picture quality is undoubtedly the best in this price range. Not just picture, sound is something which you’ll be amazed to hear! I thought I would need extra speakers but I was wrong. You don’t need any additional speakers with this TV. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a durable product without any compromise on quality in any way.",Simply the best!,B07QB77C92

Every time I paid more than 10000 to service center to repair and every time I faced a new challenge. Now, again one more problem raised inside the TV. I would suggest don't go for Sony, they only cost higher but Product is always of less quality. I am really got frustrated with Sony product.",Worst product and service from Sony,B07QB77C92

This is my second Sony BRAVIA tv. My old Sony BRAVIA which is 10 year old is still working without any issues. Picture and sound quality of this TV is excellent. Initially I thought i might need sound bar as the inbuilt tv speakers are down firing speakers. But trust me the dynamic drive speakers are awesome. You will get well balanced sound with decent bass and voice is very clear.(Thanks to ClearAudio+ digital sound processing technology). Picture quality is top. Sony’s picture quality is awesome compared to Samsung and LG. The price of Sony BRAVIA is more but you get good picture and sound quality. All the apps are running smoothly without any issues. After software update ZEE5 app is added. Though the TV runs on linux but the UI is smooth like android tv. The TV supports almost all the video formats when playing video files from the USB device. I recommend this Smart TV to everyone. Thanks SONY! ❤️,Excellent!,B07QB77C92

"I bought this product for 40k from an offline retailer. I must say I am more than impressed with this product. The colors are very vibrant and the contrast too. Speaking of sound quality, the tv is placed at a distance of 8 feet from my sofa, because the room it's kept in is quite spacious. It's 20W speakers does a brilliant job even in a room of that stature. Crisp, loud, deep bass gives you a home theater feeling. The product might be on the costlier side than other brands as sony never tries to capture the niche market, but you can blindly trust on this product.",Awesomeness at its best,B07QB77C92

"Using TV for about one month. TV audio, video works fine. One problem that I felt that you cannot change language of a dual audio file when played from USB. Checking from Customer care , they said this option is available in higher ranges of TV ( SMART TV) . So when buying a basic LED TV keep this in mind.",No dual audio support,B07QD64TL4
Sony still sells at a premium and a decent service is expected. Seems Sony has also tied up with local vendors and is not able to control their service quality. Shame. No one has turned up for installation even after confirmation. Waiting for installation... Shall put in more reviews once product is operational...,Useless service inspite of paying a premium for Sony,B07QD64TL4

Don't purchase this TV waste of money Service from Kodak is worst and also from Amazon they just don't agree the problem of product. While returning this tv I faced so many problems. Tv does not support hdmi. And it shows USB option but doesn't support USB. Amazon Customer care exicetive specially female exicetive just give rude answers and let the time pass and feel like they are the owners of Amazon.,Worst tv and worst return policy,B07R72W9K8
"I'm updating this review after Four months of use. Pros: great picture quality with high brightness, A+ grade panel in this budget. Sound is good for small room or hall. Android 7.0 Preloaded Netfllix , Amazon prime video, Hotstar, Zee5, Jio Cinema & many more. Almost every necessary apps are there in App store. Works good with wifi , can connect with mobile hotspot Miracast is working good to share your mobile screen with TV. USB drive supports well. HDMI Ports are also working fine. Cons: No Bluetooth so you can't connect your Bluetooth headphones or speakers, But you can buy Bluetooth transmitter that can help to connect. Overall value for money & can go for it without thinking more. Value for money",A smart TV with great picture quality,B07R72W9K8
"Kodak 40""smart TV is excellent with Android everything is excellent picture quality , sound quality and all facilities . Very light weight and easy to carry . And the best of it is ,it's very cheap Brands are just for unnecessary ego of people . People should buy more products like this to get more and more product like this from this manufacturer . Hail Kodak . Thanks a lot .",Worth lot more than its value .,B07R72W9K8
"Bought this TV for my room specially for Netflix and Amazon Prime. Installation was done on time and the installation staff was well trained and on time. Perfect rating for that. Once the installation was complete, the channels were playing normally but the main reason because of which we had purchased the smart TV ( netflix,amazon prime play etc ) were not working at all and the apps which were pre installed were crashing. After several attempts of trying to reinstall the app or deleting the app, I finally had to give up. Started the refund process which was quite a task as its an electronic item and returning that after installation is difficult. My suggestion is rather go for some other running brand, may be like a MI tv compared to this.",A bad decision for trying this.,B07R72W9K8
"Negatives: 1. Miracast doesn't Work. There is no question of screen mirroring for your mobiles or laptops. It doesn't get connected. I tried with one plus 6t, Poco, Macbook, nothing worked. 2. Limited storage. 3. It doesn't have any Google play store. Some custom-designed AppStore is available which has limited apps. There is no option of switching the options to desktop mode especially browser, Youtube, prime video, Netflix. 4. Apps loaded are not getting updated, therefore, you forget about new options of apps. 5. You can't sign into the Google Account for enjoying the customised experience of YouTube, or even apps. 6. No security updates available & neither are OTA upgrades. There are so many things they need to set right. Positives: 1. Picture quality is just adequate. HD looks SD but that's fine at this price. Maybe because of DishTV HD. 2. Connects well to wifi. 3. The menu option is neat and less cluttered. Very easy to switch between the TV and apps. 4. Sound is loud and clear. 5. Apps work fine. 6. You can attach a wireless keyboard and mouse for browsing. Conclusion: if you have a tight budget then this TV will work wonders for you.",Good buy with max features but screen mirroring is a problem,B07R72W9K8
"After a 2 month usage, I can say that the best part of the Kodak product is the price which is THE Best in the market, and would love to add few more such as the HD Ready picture quality is good, connectivity to WiFi has no issues and so is with the installation of apps. I dint see any issue except that YouTube app will crash when used with voice search. Other than that everything is good.",Product looks promising,B07R72W9K8
I started receiving spam calls saying that you won lucky draw for buying this kodak t.v . Contact details are shared with third party.,Spam calls and late installation process.,B07R72W9K8
"First and foremost, bare in mind, even if you pay 1.5lakh for a Sony TV, you will still have some unchecked boxes in your wish list. This is subjective and context oriented issue and will differ for every individual. From my brief usage of this TV, Video quality has been good, Audio is alright, not great but if you need better sound, you can think of adding a sound bar. Feature wise, it has almost all the features I was after, though, there is no Bluetooth. Only thing a person need to remember is more than likely they will be paying more for their mobile phone and expect more from this TV. You only get what you pay for. I compared this TV with brands like TCL, Chroma, Samsung, Panasonic, etc. This TV beats TCL and Chroma by a huge margin and is still cheaper from them. Samsung and Panasonic just marginally beats this tv in Picture quality and sound, plus one or two features but for that the cost was more than 2 times of this TV. Living in a world where technology is changing at a lightening speed, I would not want to invest too much in TV and then get stuck with it. Personally, I bought this TV so I could live with it for a couple of years and then change it but now I think it will be good for about 5 years. Also, looking at the feedback, people rate TV badly just because there was issue with logistics, use your brain and don't miss-out.",FullHD Smart TV that easily compares against leading brands for a fraction of cost,B07R72W9K8
Worst purchase experience. Installation by jeeves was a nightmare. Promised installation within 48 hrs but took more than 10 days. However Amazon assured that return policy will commence only after installation or else i would have returned the tv. Jeeves should be blacklisted for their inefficieny. Comming to the tv the wi fi reception has scope for vast improvement. Sound.... Needs a home theatre for audio to be heard if few people are around. Picture quality is average,Bad experience,B07R72W9K8
"Order delivery on time and installation person arrived on time with phone appointment but he did not know how to show the installed feature of smart tv as shown in advertise on AMAZON such as NETFLIX not working inspite of log in, HOT STAR not being login, and other feature, he was unable to show any smart function except youtube, he also said that he never installed smart feature on any tv. Very bitter experience.","No hotstar log in, Netflix login but not working, installation person do not know to show the demo.",B07R72W9K8
"There was no mentioning of Pro on the package or TV. I ordered a FUll HD TV but it is mentioned as HD TV. Picture quality is very poor and jerky. When you playback from YouTube, you can’t access menu or change picture / sound settings. During the same time I had ordered VU TV which turned out to be way better and as promised. Worst experience buying online. Not even accepting return.",Worst TV and return policy,B07R72W9K8
"One of the best budget TV ypu could get for under 10k. Picture quality is adequate, dont expect a 4k kind of display. This is a HD ready panel, so 720p is what u get. 1 thing i liked about this TV is it gives you ample settings option to tune your audio and picture quality as per your taste. I could see a huge difference in the quality after I changed my settings. BTW it has also got a eco mode which is amazing. One thing that needs improvement is Audio quality. Its Okayish, could have been better. But overall satisified. PS. I have been using all smart features(inbuilt and chromecast) since day 1 without any issues.",Good budget smart TV for under 10k,B07R72W9K8

a great disappointment for us . the TV which is delivered is not working at all. and nobody could respond to the complaint seriously. I think there is big mistake from the part of amazon.,delivered an item which is not working,B07R72W9K8

"Purchased this TV At 15k, 1. unbelievable price for this segment 2. Sound quality is best 3. Lot of room for improvement in smart features 4. Prime video can play but have to face lots of issue in navigation 5. Jio TV doesnt run on this platform, 6. Casting feature works quite well My recommendation if you have low budget and want to enjoy features of smart TV this is best product in market considering ROI",Value for money,B07R72W9K8
"The best thing about the Tv is that it works on mobile hotspot. you can expect best features compared to sony,samsung and LG at this price range. The Picture Quality is HD and the TV works efficiently. the only lagging feature is that the language option and subtitles do not change easily in Amazon prime and you cannot sign in to google play or you-tube sign in, the Wrost is the customer service, the Installation of the TV took a long time, the agent did not arrive and has still not arrived, I had to hire some-else to install my TV, The Customer service number does not work most of the time and the agents are so lousy that they do not give good response and cut the call from their end. I'm Satisfied with the TV but the Customer Service is not Good.",Value for Money but Kodak Customer service is worst,B07R72W9K8
Product is good for a beginner smart TV. Bad service from Amazon. It was purchased under emi but the same has not been communicated to the bank.,Good product but bad service from amazon,B07R72W9K8
"Finally, I bought this TV after reading so many reviews and analysis, so I though of sharing my feedback. Here are my reviews after three months of usage, hope this would be useful for other people, Kodak is offering smart TV with all the features other brands are proposing and that too within our budget. The Eastman Kodak Company (referred to simply as Kodak) is an American technology company. Price: Value for money, as the price is very low compared to all other brands, my rating for this is 3.8/5. Sound Quality: Excellent, with and without sound bar. Connectivity: Wi-Fi connectivity is good. Miracast allows you to cast your smartphone on your TV and use it as a remote and keyboard. Google Playstore is NOT available to install apps in TV. Have to install from Kodak’s app store Preloaded with Sun NXT, YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Prime, HotStar, etc.. Negatives: ~~~~~~~~~ 1) Dolby videos no working while using SunNxt Application 2) Google Accounts blocked 3) Occasionally TV is undergoing a flickering when connected to and showing content from a Setup Box via HDMI because of some Electrical Interference, for example TV blink off and signal returns after few second when the wall switch for the fans/lights is turned on/off 4) TV flickers occasionally while swapping HDMI connected port selection via remote","Excellent TV, Value for Money",B07R72W9K8
"The look and feel of the product is not great, it feels light. Packaging was good, installation part was easy as the packaging includes nuts and stand which is easy to install, I didn't wait for the installation call and did it myself. The picture quality is more than average if viewing HD, sound quality is not that great, smart tv options work fine, have been streaming Hotstar and Netflix over wifi on TV and no issues there. Overall, a very good product for this price. Perfect if you're looking for a temporary TV till the time you have enough money to buy a Samsung UHD 50 in' 😉",Value for money,B07R72W9K8
"I got a call from a person asking to write review about my Kodak TV purchase from amazon. I told him that, the product is very good and giving value for money, but the only problem facing is , casting from mobile is is not working. Then he told that he will inform this to technical team and they will contact you. But it been three weeks after that, I haven't received any call from the concerned team.,","Good product, Casting is not working.",B07R72W9K8
"I was looking for a monitor and landed up buying this product and happy so far. Pros: Needed connectivity options and value for money. Corns: You can't expect intelligent volume adjustment for multiple sources with this price, LAN port is available but not helping (could be configurable) , but never mind you may hardly use it than wifi, HDMI, USB etc. Notification noice settings not easily found out (better a remote option) - not great to hear beep when wifi goes off/on etc. One easy improvement could be made is a built-in holder in the side or back to keep USB devices, Mobile etc when wall mounted.",Good buy and Value of money,B07R72W9K8
"For the price paid, it is a decent buy. Don't expect too much out of it though. The smart features lag a bit and the quality ia quite low, but the picture and sound quality is good enough when you use it with HD DTH or though HDMI.",Buy this if you're low on budget.,B07R72W9K8

Very bad experience nobody has returned up for installation after delivery from 3 days,Installation is still pending from 3 days after delivery,B07R72W9K8
"First thing first. The TV has good picture quality and smart features for the money we have paid. It is absolutely a value for money. Sound quality is good and the connectivity features such as 3 HDMI ports, 2 RGB ports etc. are added attraction. Some further points to consider are: the internal memory is less. Also, the Android OS is very old. I am not sure how the TV would work when the OS get automatically updated.",Good value for the money paid...,B07R72W9K8

Brightness level is very good.",Overall it is a good experience..,B07R72W9K8

"When I started using the TV it felt off, I've used Mi TVs at friend's place and the picture quality looked very amazing and sound was good too. I used YouTube not so great even though it was playing in Full HD, Tried Netflix the app hanged, Tried Amazon Prime (Had to install seperately) same result of bad picture quality. Then I found out the custom android version this TV is using is really bad, like unimaginably bad. Picture Quality 4.5/5: As soon as I hooked my PS4 to the TV the real picture quality of the TV came to life, all the games, YouTube, Netflix, Prime Video, Crunchyroll everythting looked stunning. Picture Quality, Sharpness, Contrass, Brightness, Color Reproduction everything was just Wow. For me I didn't really saw any difference in picture quality between Mi TV, Vu and Kodak, TCL is very slightly better so slight that it won't be notisable. Don't judge pircure quality of this TV based on the apps installed on TV, try pen drive, laptop, console, ChromeCast or FireTV to see the panel come to life and deliver what's expected. P.S it even supports HDR output from PS4. Sound 4/5: This is where this TV excells, it has Optical Output, ARC, and the build in speakers are a blast(as compared to mediocore speakers on rest of the TVs). Speakers are loud and clear enough to not require a seperate soundbar, obviously there is very little bass but hey did you ever expected bass out of TV speakers Smart Features 1/5 : Smart features of this TV are killing the good picture and sound quality it has. Major cons are Old android version. Custom android which doesn't allow you to install apps on play store and Kodak AppStore doesn't load properly all the time. Old version of apps cannot be updated via Play Store or the Kodak Appstore Home screen is not customizable, neither of screens (Music, video, movie) are. Can change Location (Hydrabad was the default location for wateher services on my TV) YouTube looks mediocre , cannot login into YouTube. Netflix looks mediocre and hangs 80% of the time Prime Video is not available by default but if you manage to install from Kodak Appstore, video is again mediocre , app is bound to hang. All the apps are of mobile version maybe which is the reason video looks crappy on all of them. Only good thing is this is compatible with Keyboard and Mouse kudos to that.",Amazing HDTV but Really! BAD SMART TV,B07R72W9K8
"This LED TV is average in all departments. It does not excel in any particular department, however, considering the selling price, it is worth every rupee spent. It is a feature rich TV. The installation was carried out by the Technician from Jeeves Consumer Services who were appointed by the manufacturer. There was a delay in installing the TV beyond promised 48 Hrs. It was difficult to contact the manufacturer and the installer to schedule the technicians visit. However, after I posted the grievance on Manufacturer's website they contacted me immediately and informed me that they were facing technical difficulties, which led to the delay. It has been a few day since we have been using the TV and have not faced any problems with the product. The TV, pretty much, does everything that is listed in the TV's features.",Worth the money spent,B07R72W9K8

TV is as good as described on Amazon. Very good features at this price. Picture and Sound quality are good. All features working as promised. Only issue being with the customer care. My TV was delivered on 29-Sep-2019 and I had to chase the customer care every day to get it installed until 07-Oct-2019. The customer care department has no clue about the installation status and it seems to be managed by a person other than the customer care.

"It's overall a good TV for the the price. The smart features are good, but it would have been better if there was an easier way to access the apps. The main problem is picture optimization. It doesn't readgust the picture to fit the screen properly. U have to go the settings and play around with setting for almost each different video input. Also i did the main installation myself (it's not difficult), as the installation people from the company took a few days to come. Also they have no idea of the settings for the TV which u have to do urself.","Good, only a few minor issues. But Great for Price.",B07R72W9K8
Bought this 32 inch TV 1 month ago and since it is working absolutely fine. No issues at all delivery was quick but installation took 2 days. Actually there is nothing to install u can wall mount it yourself if u have drilling machine. For installation it costs rs 400 more. Bought this for rs 9000 but it's worth every penny. Now in this festival sale it is costing rs 8100. Picture quality is perfect even in non hd channel when using Tata sky. I have posted a pic of the same. Sound quality is ok not that kind which is required to dance in a big hall. Smart TV features are working fine. WiFi detection is good. And downloading apps from play store is flawless. Ab 9000 me aur Kya chayea. MI se to bhaut aacha hai. MI mehenga hai and dusri baat Chinese company hai Kodak ka TV is made in india,Worth each penny. Awesome TV,B07R72W9K8
"We wanted something that is economical yet rich in features and Kodak TV fits the bill perfectly. you will need fast internet to fully enjoy the smart bit of it. Also, it doesn't take much effort to setup support from kodak is available in case you need to wall mount the tv. they call you the same day or the next day of delivery to fix up an appointment with you. you will have to adjust the display settings to your liking to get the best results. Please don't compare it to top-end models of other brands and criticize as it does what it says on the box. my phone camera is not so good hence the blurry image. Movies play nicely from USB and support subtitles as well. I use it with firestick as I have got used to it the onboard smart features are suitable as well.",Best Led at this price point,B07R72W9K8
Mirror cast does not supported at all picture quality is also not very good.,An cheap tv,B07R72W9K8
This is a very cheap quality product. The screen looks to be a recycled one and the body is definitely made of a recycled plastic. It may break if you press it normally. The Kodak company response to the calls wasn't appropriate. Customer communication needs to be evolved. The call center for installation is dubious. Overall I think they will not be in business for long. No process in place. Don't buy it.,Don't buy you will regret,B07R72W9K8

"Its my first led tv that too smart led tv. delivery time is long. Easy installation processs. Tv is very light weight. You can hang it on wall and can place it on table. Picture quality is good. But not best as i had experienced in samsung and sony. with hd channels only picture quality is super. Sound is also good. But all sound and picture is dependent on your cable and like media you are using like full hd downloads of high gb. Using smart features needs high speed internet for smooth functioning like for youtube. For hotstar we need to purchase its premium account. Smart features ke liye sabka extra charge h for netflix etc and needs high speed net. Last one month se tv badhiya chal raha h koi dikkat nahi h Hd channels ka print picture quality bahut badhiya h. Sound bhi bahut badhiya h. Mira cast se supporting mobile connect hota h easily but aapko har bar connect karne se pehle we have to remove kodaktv from remembered group in wifi direct option under settings, otherwise it will not connect with your mobile. I purchased it in 15500 with 10% instant discount with sbi card. So overall is rate me best product h. Demo given was not proper and knowledge of demo man was inadequate. He had poor knowledge of connectivity and of screen cast. He advised me to purchase a wifi router for connecting mobile to tv. Didnt give proper demo of all functions of tv. Usb port sab tv ke peeche h ab tv wall pe lag gayi to usb connect karne ki problem h. Otherwise usb connectivity good h.

Even after paying in full You can't open the tv til the installation guy opens himself OR THEY WON'T HONOR THE WARRANTY 2. Installation guy didn't Call/Msg For 3days which was Like a nightmare. Wenever I called amazon or kodak, standard predrafted answer was ""sir calmly wait. We will Call You in 48 WORKING hrs(working hrs being d operative word_That can b stretched upto 7days depending on holidays) so u can only curse them but can't kill them 3.

Very useless product ever I have bought from Amazon this is the waste of time and money very poor customer service ever.

Now I am going to return this useless product. Guys never buy this tv very bad customer service,Very poor customer service ever,B07R72W9K8
Received the product in good condition and timely manner. Stand legs were easily screwed in and right away was able to connect to WiFi and start watching YouTube content right. Later tried casting from smartphone which also worked. Follow up service for installation by technician was declined by me as it was not needed. Trying to key in search items laborious with TV controller but text prediction helps. Yet to try watching Amazon Prime content on this device. Volume of speakers and surprisingly loud but controllable with clear sound quality. Would recommend this to other potential buyers.,Easy installation and great for watching internet content.,B07R72W9K8

The TV is actually ruined the Kodak brand. The picture quality is ok. Smart features are not user friendly and have to configure the mirroring option everytime which is really time consuming. It is not supporting voice command at all which is a basic thing in any smart TV. You can not write the content every time you are searching for and voice command would have helped this TV at least. Overall so so TV but good but at 7000/-.,"Kodak 32"" HD smart tv .. So so ok but good buy at 7k",B07R72W9K8
"I never expected such a great and smart TV in this price. Amazing picture quality with various mode like vivid, soft and many more. You can download many apps as it has inbuilt memory.

"Reviewing after 3months usage. Total failure as a smart TV. If you just want this as a TV with a light smart feature you can go for it. Pros- 1. The UI interface for smartTV is simple to understand and navigate. 2. Sound and picture quality is good. 3. Good for Youtube/Netflix/hotstar/jio movie 4. Has inbuilt Miracast but can only be used if u have a local wifi network. I tried with mobile hotspot and it didn't work. 5. Connects fast to saved wifi when power on. But after some months usage connection seems glitchy( connects n disconnects etc) Cons- It's all about the smart feature 1. Does not have Google play store installed. Even if you try to install via play store in browser , install stalls. I had to download app every time and install manually. Really a pain. But the TV has its own app store which has very minimal useful apps. So every time u have to rely on download app n install. 2. The default browser Is a disaster (scroll issue)and u can't change the default. Downloaded Firefox for Android TV which is good. 3. The smartTv Settings has limited functions and does not give the full power for Android TV usage like in other smart TVs 4. YouTube voice search crashes every time and u r stuck with typing for every YouTube search. 5. The TV has scroll issues. Better to use a wireless mouse. 6. Connected my mobile using usb and it didn't detect. Only pendrive works. Final verdict- This TV is good for anyone looking for a normal tv and an entry level smart TV experience.",Disappointing SmartTv features,B07R72W9K8
It's an excellent TV which great picture and sound quality. I had some queries about TV but thanks to Mr Shohrab who listen to my queries patiently and rectified them.,Excellent TV,B07R72W9K8
TV came without any wall. Mounting. I was charged Rs 1000 extra by the Kodak TV installation team. Kodak helpline was unavailable. When I complained to Amazon they gave an email address for Kodak which was also not working. Pathetic service by amazon when they have committed to facilitating instalation on the products description. Amazon executives in chat are even hesitant to give out their full names or email. Really hard to communicate with Amazon for this kind of a product and its installation.,TV came without wall mount. Customer care numbers are wrong.,B07R72W9K8
Based on budget it is good Sound quality not that much better,Good,B07R72W9K8

It support thousand of application designed for smart TV like YouTube, hotstar, Netflix and it also support playstore apps. I'm using opera browser, better experience than smart phone.

"I wrote this review after 30 days usage of Kodak smart TV. Picture quality is ok range, sound quality is also good.

Second of all the YouTube app worked for few mins n den stopped working after trying all the ways to fix the issue.. Yet to find for the other apps.. Its hard time to reach the kodak customer service for the installation... If all these issues are fixed i would prefer to rate the product 4 out of 5",Buy at your own risk,B07R72W9K8

"The Kodak Company's 9-inch television was taken at Amazon Navratri Festival from May to November, but the delivery of the television was absolutely negative, but one thing that was very negative was that there was no reply from the Kodak Company's toll fee number regarding private install / television.

"Arrived on time, nicely packed, nothing missing. Did not wait for installation, it is a simple plug and play TV. Connecting it took less than 5 minutes. Youtube, Netflix and other apps are built-in and function like a pro. Watched a Netflix movie without a hitch in streaming. Picture quality is superb. Sound is not the best in class though. Very lightweight, have used the table mount legs to set it up, all you need is a star screwdriver.",Product is nice at given price. Fully worth of cost.,B07R72W9K8
This smart TV is really best at its price range. This has very good picture quality. This would have been even more better if it has Bluetooth facility. However it needs some improvement on audio quality because sometimes audio automatically goes off and has to restart the TV for solving the problem. TV remote consumes more battery because whenever power goes off remote is required everytime for starting TV. Despite these minor shortcomings this TV is superb at its price range.,Best smart TV in economy price range.,B07R72W9K8

"Hello buyers, Just want to alert you that the bluetooth feature in this TV will only connect bluetooth mouse and bluetooth keyboard. It will not connect to any bluetooth speaker , bluetooth home theater or any other blutooth device. On Amazon, they have just written supports bluetooth as yes, which is definitely misleading, and I am the victim of it. I paid 10000 extra only for getting bluetooth so that I can connect my bluetooth speaker with it but when I installed this TV and tried to configure my speaker it was not even getting searched. Then I called SONY company and they told me that we can only connect bluetooth mouse and bluetooth keyboard in thie version of TV. Please be aware before buying it. Either buy an earlier version (which does not have bluetooth but other features are exactly the same) or if you want a real and proper bluetooth TV , go for higher versions. Thanks",Bluetooth connects only mouse and keyboard,B07RFWXM96
"This 2019 sony X8000G is same as like 2017 sony lineup tv X8200E.. Same price Range 84k after 2 years, Sony didn't reduced the price... In spec they Reduced speakers from 40w in 2017 to 20w in 2019... Nothing other changed, Same spec (Triluminos display, 4k hdr, android tv) ... 2017- Sony 43"" X8200E - ₹82000 box price, then 76k 2019-Sony 43"" X8000g - ₹84000 box proce, then 66k, but 2 yr old spec nearly same price Sony really need to Upgrade their TV’s... Sony TV’s Are like Apple iphones in india... More Tax...(in other countries sony big screen tv cost low compare to india) eg: In dubai(uae) sony 55-inch x8500f cost 50k-56k in indian price but here more than 85k..).. Guys i been searching for good tv for past 2 years, I'm not satisfied yet.. I will update here once i get new tv... Here are the list yu can remember before yu buy.. If you are sony fan try to find it year from its model Eg: X8200E - E for 2017 model X8500F - F for 2018 models X8000G - G for 2019 models 1. Picture quality and Sound (4k hdr, hdr10+, dolby vision, dolby speaker) HDR- like android , Dolby - like apple IOS.. these are future.. 2. UI ( As for now 1. Lg-(Web Os) is fast, 2. Samsung (Tizen) - good, 3. Sony,Tcl- (Android)- Laggy..) only oled sony tv UI are fast, for other sony Android TV's its slow.. 3. Don't buy without seeing it in real, go and visit store and experience it, (They usually demo 4k content, ask them to play SD, HD content... So that yu can see how tv upsales the picture quality... In india mostly we have SD, HD content.. I can suggest you some tv models.. 1. Samsung The Frame 55"" Tv, is now on offer for 80k on Flipkart, it has qled tv not normal led... It is online exclusive on Flipkart and Samsung store... You will get all the high end features in this tv... It is great for gaming too, has 120hz refresh rate... It has one connect box where yu can connect all cables(usb, dish, power) only one cable that connect tv to one connect box..this one connect box available only for top end tv's in samsung like Q90, Q80, Q80.. This is the only tv that has this option under 85k.. Tv is just flat, it has zero gap wall mount too..it means no gap between wall and tv... Booting time is really fast not like android... It has art mode (like frame on your wall) and motion sensor, it will turn off automatically when no motion is detected, and on automatically when person is before tv.. I been searching for good tv for the past 2 years, at last i decided to buy this samsung frame Qled tv... Some other tv in my suggestions.. 1. LG C8 oled for 1lk.. If you are from Tamil Nadu and if you like oled tv for 1 lk... Visit (sathya stores) in the city.. You can get LG C8 oled for 1lk.. You can visit their website too.. Its 2018 lg flagship tv... Yu can visit the store and buy.. 2. In Tcl C series tv.. Like C6(120hz refresh rate and front firing speaker) , C2(last yr model) ... 3. Vu premium android 4k tv, buy this series on Flipkart... If you want budget... If yu feel picture motion is laggy, try to see it on movie mode.. Better visit vu store and check.. 4. Sony bravia X95G, cost is high above 1lk.. X85G=X85F(same spec only difference X85G has dolby atmos and dolby sound currently available in 55""...cost under 1lk... Before buying it online..

"1. Sony TV is anyday good, thought of buying Oneplus QLED but 1+ seems to be having lot of issues. 2. Better to go for bigger screen. 3. Getting extremely good Dolby digital when connected to 5.1 home theatre especially on AmazonPrime and YouTube. 4. 1/2* for Amazon they didn't give me Oakter smart home kit worth 8.5k, it is better to buy from retail outlet near your house they are better and they have similar offers.",Good TV,B07RFWXM96

"The Sony X800F is the best 65 inch 4k TV in the mid-range category. It's a great 4k TV that delivers great overall picture quality with deep blacks, excellent peak brightness, and a wide color gamut for HDR content. It also has great smart features, with one of the widest selections of apps, and the interface has recently been updated to the even easier to use Android Oreo. This TV has outstanding motion handling, thanks to its remarkable response time, similar to the P Series Quantum, so there is almost no noticeable blur trail behind fast-moving objects. Unfortunately, the best image quality is reserved for this sitting directly in front, as the image degrades when viewed at an angle. The full array local dimming feature is decent but may be distracting at times. Overall, this is a great 4k TV and the best 65 inch TV for the money as tested.","Overall, this is a great 4k TV and the best 65 inch TV for the money as tested.",B07RFWXM96
Very good TV,Very good TV,B07RFWXM96
I have not purchsed this tv from amazon but I will still give a review so that it can be helpful to other buyers. The picture quality is beyond doubt the best amongst all other tv's available in 43 inch segment. The motion flow technology for videos is just awwwwww awesome. U can upscale any stamdard video easily and its motion flow would surprise you in the best possible way. Other android features are in line with user requirement and any tech guy would love it. Only one surprise is that the screen has 50 hertz refresh rate but it is taken care of by upscaling motion flow enhacement. Overall this is a very good product but the price is a little bit on the higher side.,The best there is in this segment (43 inch),B07RFWXM96
Can connect Bluetooth with headphones and speakers as well Picture quality better than the previous Sony android tv series 3.0 USB port 1Amp output USB port for charging InBuilt Screen Mirroring WifiDirect 4K HDR Bass Reflex In Built Speakers In Short Your all needs from a Android Tv ends up here,Best Series #X80-G,B07RFWXM96
How can anyone buy this costly TV unless he has lots and lots of black money. Government needs to bring more strict anti corruption laws .,Beautiful.,B07RFWXM96
I decided to gift my parents a 43 inch 4k tv for their anniversary. After a lot of research on shops & online portals I decided to buy this TV. In beginning I was a little skeptical looking at the cost as my budget was 50k but bought it on prime day at a discounted rate of 62k as I had experienced the product at a nearby store. Go it delivered to my hometown & called up Sony guys & they were quick in installation. In my opinion display quality & design of the product is just out of the world. Cool features like Android & voice assistant are an added advantage. My parents loved the gift & are very happy with it. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who’s looking for a premium 4K TV. Don’t compromise on quality because of a little price difference. You can go for no cost EMI just like I did. Hope this helps.,Super product. Worth every penny!,B07RFWXM96

Don't purchase this TV waste of money Service from Kodak is worst and also from Amazon they just don't agree the problem of product. While returning this tv I faced so many problems. Tv does not support hdmi. And it shows USB option but doesn't support USB. Amazon Customer care exicetive specially female exicetive just give rude answers and let the time pass and feel like they are the owners of Amazon.,Worst tv and worst return policy,B07RJQYL97
"I'm updating this review after Four months of use. Pros: great picture quality with high brightness, A+ grade panel in this budget. Sound is good for small room or hall. Android 7.0 Preloaded Netfllix , Amazon prime video, Hotstar, Zee5, Jio Cinema & many more. Almost every necessary apps are there in App store. Works good with wifi , can connect with mobile hotspot Miracast is working good to share your mobile screen with TV. USB drive supports well. HDMI Ports are also working fine. Cons: No Bluetooth so you can't connect your Bluetooth headphones or speakers, But you can buy Bluetooth transmitter that can help to connect. Overall value for money & can go for it without thinking more. Value for money",A smart TV with great picture quality,B07RJQYL97
"Kodak 40""smart TV is excellent with Android everything is excellent picture quality , sound quality and all facilities . Very light weight and easy to carry . And the best of it is ,it's very cheap Brands are just for unnecessary ego of people . People should buy more products like this to get more and more product like this from this manufacturer . Hail Kodak . Thanks a lot .",Worth lot more than its value .,B07RJQYL97
"Bought this TV for my room specially for Netflix and Amazon Prime. Installation was done on time and the installation staff was well trained and on time. Perfect rating for that. Once the installation was complete, the channels were playing normally but the main reason because of which we had purchased the smart TV ( netflix,amazon prime play etc ) were not working at all and the apps which were pre installed were crashing. After several attempts of trying to reinstall the app or deleting the app, I finally had to give up. Started the refund process which was quite a task as its an electronic item and returning that after installation is difficult. My suggestion is rather go for some other running brand, may be like a MI tv compared to this.",A bad decision for trying this.,B07RJQYL97
"Negatives: 1. Miracast doesn't Work. There is no question of screen mirroring for your mobiles or laptops. It doesn't get connected. I tried with one plus 6t, Poco, Macbook, nothing worked. 2. Limited storage. 3. It doesn't have any Google play store. Some custom-designed AppStore is available which has limited apps. There is no option of switching the options to desktop mode especially browser, Youtube, prime video, Netflix. 4. Apps loaded are not getting updated, therefore, you forget about new options of apps. 5. You can't sign into the Google Account for enjoying the customised experience of YouTube, or even apps. 6. No security updates available & neither are OTA upgrades. There are so many things they need to set right. Positives: 1. Picture quality is just adequate. HD looks SD but that's fine at this price. Maybe because of DishTV HD. 2. Connects well to wifi. 3. The menu option is neat and less cluttered. Very easy to switch between the TV and apps. 4. Sound is loud and clear. 5. Apps work fine. 6. You can attach a wireless keyboard and mouse for browsing. Conclusion: if you have a tight budget then this TV will work wonders for you.",Good buy with max features but screen mirroring is a problem,B07RJQYL97
"After a 2 month usage, I can say that the best part of the Kodak product is the price which is THE Best in the market, and would love to add few more such as the HD Ready picture quality is good, connectivity to WiFi has no issues and so is with the installation of apps. I dint see any issue except that YouTube app will crash when used with voice search. Other than that everything is good.",Product looks promising,B07RJQYL97
I started receiving spam calls saying that you won lucky draw for buying this kodak t.v . Contact details are shared with third party.,Spam calls and late installation process.,B07RJQYL97
"First and foremost, bare in mind, even if you pay 1.5lakh for a Sony TV, you will still have some unchecked boxes in your wish list. This is subjective and context oriented issue and will differ for every individual. From my brief usage of this TV, Video quality has been good, Audio is alright, not great but if you need better sound, you can think of adding a sound bar. Feature wise, it has almost all the features I was after, though, there is no Bluetooth. Only thing a person need to remember is more than likely they will be paying more for their mobile phone and expect more from this TV. You only get what you pay for. I compared this TV with brands like TCL, Chroma, Samsung, Panasonic, etc. This TV beats TCL and Chroma by a huge margin and is still cheaper from them. Samsung and Panasonic just marginally beats this tv in Picture quality and sound, plus one or two features but for that the cost was more than 2 times of this TV. Living in a world where technology is changing at a lightening speed, I would not want to invest too much in TV and then get stuck with it. Personally, I bought this TV so I could live with it for a couple of years and then change it but now I think it will be good for about 5 years. Also, looking at the feedback, people rate TV badly just because there was issue with logistics, use your brain and don't miss-out.",FullHD Smart TV that easily compares against leading brands for a fraction of cost,B07RJQYL97
Worst purchase experience. Installation by jeeves was a nightmare. Promised installation within 48 hrs but took more than 10 days. However Amazon assured that return policy will commence only after installation or else i would have returned the tv. Jeeves should be blacklisted for their inefficieny. Comming to the tv the wi fi reception has scope for vast improvement. Sound.... Needs a home theatre for audio to be heard if few people are around. Picture quality is average,Bad experience,B07RJQYL97
"Order delivery on time and installation person arrived on time with phone appointment but he did not know how to show the installed feature of smart tv as shown in advertise on AMAZON such as NETFLIX not working inspite of log in, HOT STAR not being login, and other feature, he was unable to show any smart function except youtube, he also said that he never installed smart feature on any tv. Very bitter experience.","No hotstar log in, Netflix login but not working, installation person do not know to show the demo.",B07RJQYL97
"Recently bought this TV on Prime day sale. Will say this , For the given price of INR 8000 (including prime day discount+HDFC discount) its the best configuration you will get with all the smart features. If you compare it with Mi TV which is currently market leading smart TV, only 2 drawbacks: 1. Android Version of Kodak TV is 7.1.2, little bit outdated and no option of updating software OTA. Can be updated only offline via zip file. 2. Kodak TV doesn't have Bluetooth, but external dongle can be used. Although, i would like to emphasize on using external speakers if you have any, because default speakers of Kodak TV are not that great in terms of Bass. Rest all other aspects, Kodak is offering smart TV with all the features other brands are offering and that too within budget.",Good Product at the given price,B07RJQYL97
"TV delivered on 15th August, as per installation policy of 72 hours, not received call for installation till date and kodak customer care number is invalid. Only god will know after installation if any problem in product were to contact. Please check and revert asap.",Installation issue,B07RJQYL97

"Arrived on time, nicely packed, nothing missing. Did not wait for installation, it is a simple plug and play TV. Connecting it took less than 5 minutes. Youtube, Netflix and other apps are built-in and function like a pro. Watched a Netflix movie without a hitch in streaming. Picture quality is superb. Sound is not the best in class though. Very lightweight, have used the table mount legs to set it up, all you need is a star screwdriver. Will update review after 3 months.",Great value TV,B07RJQYL97
Please dont buy. Cheap quantity and horrible customer support service even in metro cities. Not working only after one month of use and waiting since one month to get it repaired.,Cheap quantity and horrible customer support,B07RJQYL97
"Kodak is one of the most trusted international brand. I'm using this product for 2 weeks not faced any type of issue yet. Sound quality is fantastic, for better sound quality there's 20 w speaker is effecient for a standard room. Everything you expect from a smart TV is there to entertain you. It support thousand of application designed for smart TV like YouTube, hotstar, Netflix and it also support playstore apps. I'm using opera browser, better experience than smart phone. You can also connect mouse and keyboard. Only negative about this product is it's connectivity, there's no Bluetooth. Overall smart choice",Best Smart TV in this price range.,B07RJQYL97
No calls from Kodak for the demo as it is not Amazon's responsibilities to arrange for the demo. Got an update from Amazon that you will get a call from them in 24 hours and installation will be done. But last 72 hours no calls came in.,2 Days after purchase!!,B07RJQYL97
Smart features are too outdated Amazon prime is not there as an app When you switch to plain black channel you dont see uniform black display i saw a burned display on my TV It take time to turn on when switched on unlike other TV's I tried putting USB for listening songs it didnt play the USB inspite to 2 USB connections. No feature to start over the movie on netflix it played from half way and could start it from begining. Price is less for a reason !!,Below Average,B07RJQYL97
It’s the worst experience ever . YouTube app is not working and I have been promised by Kodak to look into it and it doesn’t happen. Nobody comes even after emailing and waiting,Worst service and product,B07RJQYL97
"There was no mentioning of Pro on the package or TV. I ordered a FUll HD TV but it is mentioned as HD TV. Picture quality is very poor and jerky. When you playback from YouTube, you can’t access menu or change picture / sound settings. During the same time I had ordered VU TV which turned out to be way better and as promised. Worst experience buying online. Not even accepting return.",Worst TV and return policy,B07RJQYL97
"One of the best budget TV ypu could get for under 10k. Picture quality is adequate, dont expect a 4k kind of display. This is a HD ready panel, so 720p is what u get. 1 thing i liked about this TV is it gives you ample settings option to tune your audio and picture quality as per your taste. I could see a huge difference in the quality after I changed my settings. BTW it has also got a eco mode which is amazing. One thing that needs improvement is Audio quality. Its Okayish, could have been better. But overall satisified. PS. I have been using all smart features(inbuilt and chromecast) since day 1 without any issues.",Good budget smart TV for under 10k,B07RJQYL97

a great disappointment for us . the TV which is delivered is not working at all. and nobody could respond to the complaint seriously. I think there is big mistake from the part of amazon.,delivered an item which is not working,B07RJQYL97
"Once you buy the product, you can't return it, if you don't like it. Amazon will not take any responsibility. They are saying talk to Kodak.",Don't think Kodak will make quality product,B07RJQYL97
"Purchased this TV At 15k, 1. unbelievable price for this segment 2. Sound quality is best 3. Lot of room for improvement in smart features 4. Prime video can play but have to face lots of issue in navigation 5. Jio TV doesnt run on this platform, 6. Casting feature works quite well My recommendation if you have low budget and want to enjoy features of smart TV this is best product in market considering ROI",Value for money,B07RJQYL97
"The best thing about the Tv is that it works on mobile hotspot. you can expect best features compared to sony,samsung and LG at this price range. The Picture Quality is HD and the TV works efficiently. the only lagging feature is that the language option and subtitles do not change easily in Amazon prime and you cannot sign in to google play or you-tube sign in, the Wrost is the customer service, the Installation of the TV took a long time, the agent did not arrive and has still not arrived, I had to hire some-else to install my TV, The Customer service number does not work most of the time and the agents are so lousy that they do not give good response and cut the call from their end. I'm Satisfied with the TV but the Customer Service is not Good.",Value for Money but Kodak Customer service is worst,B07RJQYL97
Product is good for a beginner smart TV. Bad service from Amazon. It was purchased under emi but the same has not been communicated to the bank.,Good product but bad service from amazon,B07RJQYL97
"Finally, I bought this TV after reading so many reviews and analysis, so I though of sharing my feedback. Here are my reviews after three months of usage, hope this would be useful for other people, Kodak is offering smart TV with all the features other brands are proposing and that too within our budget. The Eastman Kodak Company (referred to simply as Kodak) is an American technology company. Price: Value for money, as the price is very low compared to all other brands, my rating for this is 3.8/5. Sound Quality: Excellent, with and without sound bar. Connectivity: Wi-Fi connectivity is good. Miracast allows you to cast your smartphone on your TV and use it as a remote and keyboard. Google Playstore is NOT available to install apps in TV. Have to install from Kodak’s app store Preloaded with Sun NXT, YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Prime, HotStar, etc.. Negatives: ~~~~~~~~~ 1) Dolby videos no working while using SunNxt Application 2) Google Accounts blocked 3) Occasionally TV is undergoing a flickering when connected to and showing content from a Setup Box via HDMI because of some Electrical Interference, for example TV blink off and signal returns after few second when the wall switch for the fans/lights is turned on/off 4) TV flickers occasionally while swapping HDMI connected port selection via remote","Excellent TV, Value for Money",B07RJQYL97
"The look and feel of the product is not great, it feels light. Packaging was good, installation part was easy as the packaging includes nuts and stand which is easy to install, I didn't wait for the installation call and did it myself. The picture quality is more than average if viewing HD, sound quality is not that great, smart tv options work fine, have been streaming Hotstar and Netflix over wifi on TV and no issues there. Overall, a very good product for this price. Perfect if you're looking for a temporary TV till the time you have enough money to buy a Samsung UHD 50 in' 😉",Value for money,B07RJQYL97
"I got a call from a person asking to write review about my Kodak TV purchase from amazon. I told him that, the product is very good and giving value for money, but the only problem facing is , casting from mobile is is not working. Then he told that he will inform this to technical team and they will contact you. But it been three weeks after that, I haven't received any call from the concerned team.,","Good product, Casting is not working.",B07RJQYL97
"I was looking for a monitor and landed up buying this product and happy so far. Pros: Needed connectivity options and value for money. Corns: You can't expect intelligent volume adjustment for multiple sources with this price, LAN port is available but not helping (could be configurable) , but never mind you may hardly use it than wifi, HDMI, USB etc. Notification noice settings not easily found out (better a remote option) - not great to hear beep when wifi goes off/on etc. One easy improvement could be made is a built-in holder in the side or back to keep USB devices, Mobile etc when wall mounted.",Good buy and Value of money,B07RJQYL97
"For the price paid, it is a decent buy. Don't expect too much out of it though. The smart features lag a bit and the quality ia quite low, but the picture and sound quality is good enough when you use it with HD DTH or though HDMI.",Buy this if you're low on budget.,B07RJQYL97

Very bad experience nobody has returned up for installation after delivery from 3 days,Installation is still pending from 3 days after delivery,B07RJQYL97
"First thing first. The TV has good picture quality and smart features for the money we have paid. It is absolutely a value for money. Sound quality is good and the connectivity features such as 3 HDMI ports, 2 RGB ports etc. are added attraction. Some further points to consider are: the internal memory is less. Also, the Android OS is very old. I am not sure how the TV would work when the OS get automatically updated.",Good value for the money paid...,B07RJQYL97

Brightness level is very good.",Overall it is a good experience..,B07RJQYL97
Some time screen goes black,Response,B07RJQYL97
"When I started using the TV it felt off, I've used Mi TVs at friend's place and the picture quality looked very amazing and sound was good too. I used YouTube not so great even though it was playing in Full HD, Tried Netflix the app hanged, Tried Amazon Prime (Had to install seperately) same result of bad picture quality. Then I found out the custom android version this TV is using is really bad, like unimaginably bad. Picture Quality 4.5/5: As soon as I hooked my PS4 to the TV the real picture quality of the TV came to life, all the games, YouTube, Netflix, Prime Video, Crunchyroll everythting looked stunning. Picture Quality, Sharpness, Contrass, Brightness, Color Reproduction everything was just Wow. For me I didn't really saw any difference in picture quality between Mi TV, Vu and Kodak, TCL is very slightly better so slight that it won't be notisable. Don't judge pircure quality of this TV based on the apps installed on TV, try pen drive, laptop, console, ChromeCast or FireTV to see the panel come to life and deliver what's expected. P.S it even supports HDR output from PS4. Sound 4/5: This is where this TV excells, it has Optical Output, ARC, and the build in speakers are a blast(as compared to mediocore speakers on rest of the TVs). Speakers are loud and clear enough to not require a seperate soundbar, obviously there is very little bass but hey did you ever expected bass out of TV speakers Smart Features 1/5 : Smart features of this TV are killing the good picture and sound quality it has. Major cons are Old android version. Custom android which doesn't allow you to install apps on play store and Kodak AppStore doesn't load properly all the time. Old version of apps cannot be updated via Play Store or the Kodak Appstore Home screen is not customizable, neither of screens (Music, video, movie) are. Can change Location (Hydrabad was the default location for wateher services on my TV) YouTube looks mediocre , cannot login into YouTube. Netflix looks mediocre and hangs 80% of the time Prime Video is not available by default but if you manage to install from Kodak Appstore, video is again mediocre , app is bound to hang. All the apps are of mobile version maybe which is the reason video looks crappy on all of them. Only good thing is this is compatible with Keyboard and Mouse kudos to that.",Amazing HDTV but Really! BAD SMART TV,B07RJQYL97
"This LED TV is average in all departments. It does not excel in any particular department, however, considering the selling price, it is worth every rupee spent. It is a feature rich TV. The installation was carried out by the Technician from Jeeves Consumer Services who were appointed by the manufacturer. There was a delay in installing the TV beyond promised 48 Hrs. It was difficult to contact the manufacturer and the installer to schedule the technicians visit. However, after I posted the grievance on Manufacturer's website they contacted me immediately and informed me that they were facing technical difficulties, which led to the delay. It has been a few day since we have been using the TV and have not faced any problems with the product. The TV, pretty much, does everything that is listed in the TV's features.",Worth the money spent,B07RJQYL97
Ok.. Fine.. Kodak led 40 inch overall super... Full hd... Pro... First day only I connected to mob hot spot and watch a movie in you tube... Full clear.. Very happy.. in DTH it's ok...

In some reviews told update not available but it is ther. In app store we can update,Suuuuper..,B07RJQYL97
Sound not good no quality but value for money in this range of it is better that Kodak have to give a Dolby digital plus sound in TV But all over is good,Waste of money and as quality as money u keep,B07RJQYL97
TV is as good as described on Amazon. Very good features at this price. Picture and Sound quality are good. All features working as promised. Only issue being with the customer care. My TV was delivered on 29-Sep-2019 and I had to chase the customer care every day to get it installed until 07-Oct-2019. The customer care department has no clue about the installation status and it seems to be managed by a person other than the customer care.

"No smart features are working on it even no YouTube is paying , each app is chashing while opening..","No smart features are working , even YouTube is crashing before opening",B07RJQYL97
"It's overall a good TV for the the price. The smart features are good, but it would have been better if there was an easier way to access the apps. The main problem is picture optimization. It doesn't readgust the picture to fit the screen properly. U have to go the settings and play around with setting for almost each different video input. Also i did the main installation myself (it's not difficult), as the installation people from the company took a few days to come. Also they have no idea of the settings for the TV which u have to do urself.","Good, only a few minor issues. But Great for Price.",B07RJQYL97
Bought this 32 inch TV 1 month ago and since it is working absolutely fine. No issues at all delivery was quick but installation took 2 days. Actually there is nothing to install u can wall mount it yourself if u have drilling machine. For installation it costs rs 400 more. Bought this for rs 9000 but it's worth every penny. Now in this festival sale it is costing rs 8100. Picture quality is perfect even in non hd channel when using Tata sky. I have posted a pic of the same. Sound quality is ok not that kind which is required to dance in a big hall. Smart TV features are working fine. WiFi detection is good. And downloading apps from play store is flawless. Ab 9000 me aur Kya chayea. MI se to bhaut aacha hai. MI mehenga hai and dusri baat Chinese company hai Kodak ka TV is made in india,Worth each penny. Awesome TV,B07RJQYL97
"We wanted something that is economical yet rich in features and Kodak TV fits the bill perfectly. you will need fast internet to fully enjoy the smart bit of it. Also, it doesn't take much effort to setup support from kodak is available in case you need to wall mount the tv. they call you the same day or the next day of delivery to fix up an appointment with you. you will have to adjust the display settings to your liking to get the best results. Please don't compare it to top-end models of other brands and criticize as it does what it says on the box. my phone camera is not so good hence the blurry image. Movies play nicely from USB and support subtitles as well. I use it with firestick as I have got used to it the onboard smart features are suitable as well.",Best Led at this price point,B07RJQYL97
Mirror cast does not supported at all picture quality is also not very good.,An cheap tv,B07RJQYL97
This is a very cheap quality product. The screen looks to be a recycled one and the body is definitely made of a recycled plastic. It may break if you press it normally. The Kodak company response to the calls wasn't appropriate. Customer communication needs to be evolved. The call center for installation is dubious. Overall I think they will not be in business for long. No process in place. Don't buy it.,Don't buy you will regret,B07RJQYL97
THINK 100 times before by this product. Worst service from brand and amazon home services.,Not worth for single star too.,B07RJQYL97

"Pros: Value for money. Found it worth the money spent. Smooth free installation. Great sound and picture quality. App store has most of the popular subscription apps. Cons: Lacks bluetooth connectivity. Have to struggle in some apps with the cursor. Remote lacks the buttons directly for Netflix, Prime, etc.",Value for money !!,B07RJQYL97
It's not upto the mark...plastics r cheap..remote plastic quality also cheap Pay more and buy a better oroduct,Cheap plastics,B07RJQYL97
"Do not buy. Not recommended. It has been more than 15 days i bought the tv, and no response from installation team. I am tired of complaining to their customer care. Even calling the customer care is a hassle, their IVR machine starts talking after connecting the call and either disconnects by itself or does not connect to customer service representative. The tv is still kept in the box. No use",Not recommended. No service at all,B07RJQYL97

"Pathetic service by Kodak, even the 7 days paased after the delivery, No installation help was provided by Kodak. I called the helpline number provided on amazon- 18001033036 And 180030002228 Neary thousand times, but no response. They do not pick up the phone, it keeps ringing. If u are lucky enough then only ur call will be picked once after 100 of tries. They provide another number 9711248287 and this person never picks up the phone.

"I have purchased 32 inches LED TV for guest bedroom. - TV is sleek and light weight. - Sound Quality is good. - Processor is slow. It takes 1 minute to boot. - Downloaded apps crashing. I have tried India Today and Fox News apps. - Navigation is bit confusing. - Display of small letters is blurry. - Best customer support. Technician he himself called me and came to my home for installation. - Its MRP was Rs. 21,000. On offer it was priced at Rs. 9,000. I have purchased it with exchange of old LCD with final price of Rs. 6,500. - Value for Money - Good for guest rooms or children bedrooms where there is a limited usage.",Value for Money,B07RJQYL97

"Its my first led tv that too smart led tv. delivery time is long. Easy installation processs. Tv is very light weight. You can hang it on wall and can place it on table. Picture quality is good. But not best as i had experienced in samsung and sony. with hd channels only picture quality is super. Sound is also good. But all sound and picture is dependent on your cable and like media you are using like full hd downloads of high gb. Using smart features needs high speed internet for smooth functioning like for youtube. For hotstar we need to purchase its premium account. Smart features ke liye sabka extra charge h for netflix etc and needs high speed net. Last one month se tv badhiya chal raha h koi dikkat nahi h Hd channels ka print picture quality bahut badhiya h. Sound bhi bahut badhiya h. Mira cast se supporting mobile connect hota h easily but aapko har bar connect karne se pehle we have to remove kodaktv from remembered group in wifi direct option under settings, otherwise it will not connect with your mobile. I purchased it in 15500 with 10% instant discount with sbi card. So overall is rate me best product h. Demo given was not proper and knowledge of demo man was inadequate. He had poor knowledge of connectivity and of screen cast. He advised me to purchase a wifi router for connecting mobile to tv. Didnt give proper demo of all functions of tv. Usb port sab tv ke peeche h ab tv wall pe lag gayi to usb connect karne ki problem h. Otherwise usb connectivity good h. For this u have to purchase wall mount seperately.",Super in this price.,B07RJQYL97
"This is my 1st negative fdbk/ review because I believe in positive karma but I've had enough of ""rules of amazon"" 1. Even after paying in full You can't open the tv til the installation guy opens himself OR THEY WON'T HONOR THE WARRANTY 2. Installation guy didn't Call/Msg For 3days which was Like a nightmare. Wenever I called amazon or kodak, standard predrafted answer was ""sir calmly wait. We will Call You in 48 WORKING hrs(working hrs being d operative word_That can b stretched upto 7days depending on holidays) so u can only curse them but can't kill them 3. There Should a strict policy of nxtday installation or return the tv. Hell yaaaa ! I've paid in full N It's my tv. Y Should I wait at the mecy of some installatiin guy who doesnt bother to Call For 3days ? 4. NOW ABT THE TV_ It's an Avg HD tv. Colors are too vivid so every chnl, u'hv to manually set the color which is too annoying 5. USB slot is totally hidden at the back n 100% unreachable until You take it out of the bracket. So everytime It's the same parade if You wanna insert a pen drive_not atall user freindly :( OVERALL, this time the experience was pathetic",Not happy :(,B07RJQYL97

Now I am going to return this useless product. Guys never buy this tv very bad customer service,Very poor customer service ever,B07RJQYL97
Received the product in good condition and timely manner. Stand legs were easily screwed in and right away was able to connect to WiFi and start watching YouTube content right. Later tried casting from smartphone which also worked. Follow up service for installation by technician was declined by me as it was not needed. Trying to key in search items laborious with TV controller but text prediction helps. Yet to try watching Amazon Prime content on this device. Volume of speakers and surprisingly loud but controllable with clear sound quality. Would recommend this to other potential buyers.,Easy installation and great for watching internet content.,B07RJQYL97

The TV is actually ruined the Kodak brand. The picture quality is ok. Smart features are not user friendly and have to configure the mirroring option everytime which is really time consuming. It is not supporting voice command at all which is a basic thing in any smart TV. You can not write the content every time you are searching for and voice command would have helped this TV at least. Overall so so TV but good but at 7000/-.,"Kodak 32"" HD smart tv .. So so ok but good buy at 7k",B07RJQYL97
"I never expected such a great and smart TV in this price. Amazing picture quality with various mode like vivid, soft and many more. You can download many apps as it has inbuilt memory.

"Reviewing after 3months usage. Total failure as a smart TV. If you just want this as a TV with a light smart feature you can go for it. Pros- 1. The UI interface for smartTV is simple to understand and navigate. 2. Sound and picture quality is good. 3. Good for Youtube/Netflix/hotstar/jio movie 4. Has inbuilt Miracast but can only be used if u have a local wifi network. I tried with mobile hotspot and it didn't work. 5. Connects fast to saved wifi when power on. But after some months usage connection seems glitchy( connects n disconnects etc) Cons- It's all about the smart feature 1. Does not have Google play store installed. Even if you try to install via play store in browser , install stalls. I had to download app every time and install manually. Really a pain. But the TV has its own app store which has very minimal useful apps. So every time u have to rely on download app n install. 2. The default browser Is a disaster (scroll issue)and u can't change the default. Downloaded Firefox for Android TV which is good. 3. The smartTv Settings has limited functions and does not give the full power for Android TV usage like in other smart TVs 4. YouTube voice search crashes every time and u r stuck with typing for every YouTube search. 5. The TV has scroll issues. Better to use a wireless mouse. 6. Connected my mobile using usb and it didn't detect. Only pendrive works. Final verdict- This TV is good for anyone looking for a normal tv and an entry level smart TV experience.",Disappointing SmartTv features,B07RJQYL97
It's an excellent TV which great picture and sound quality. I had some queries about TV but thanks to Mr Shohrab who listen to my queries patiently and rectified them.,Excellent TV,B07RJQYL97
TV came without any wall. Mounting. I was charged Rs 1000 extra by the Kodak TV installation team. Kodak helpline was unavailable. When I complained to Amazon they gave an email address for Kodak which was also not working. Pathetic service by amazon when they have committed to facilitating instalation on the products description. Amazon executives in chat are even hesitant to give out their full names or email. Really hard to communicate with Amazon for this kind of a product and its installation.,TV came without wall mount. Customer care numbers are wrong.,B07RJQYL97
Based on budget it is good Sound quality not that much better,Good,B07RJQYL97
I am not happy with this product as i got few color dots on display and black spots in display. I know for this price we cannot expect perfect but not the compromised display.

Sound quality is fantastic, for better sound quality there's 20 w speaker is effecient for a standard room. Everything you expect from a smart TV is there to entertain you. It support thousand of application designed for smart TV like YouTube, hotstar, Netflix and it also support playstore apps. I'm using opera browser, better experience than smart phone. You can also connect mouse and keyboard. Only negative about this product is it's connectivity, there's no Bluetooth. Overall smart choice",A smart TV with great picture collety,B07RJQYL97
"I wrote this review after 30 days usage of Kodak smart TV. Picture quality is ok range, sound quality is also good.

Second of all the YouTube app worked for few mins n den stopped working after trying all the ways to fix the issue.. Yet to find for the other apps..

Very lightweight, have used the table mount legs to set it up, all you need is a star screwdriver.",Product is nice at given price. Fully worth of cost.,B07RJQYL97
This smart TV is really best at its price range. This has very good picture quality. This would have been even more better if it has Bluetooth facility. However it needs some improvement on audio quality because sometimes audio automatically goes off and has to restart the TV for solving the problem. TV remote consumes more battery because whenever power goes off remote is required everytime for starting TV. Despite these minor shortcomings this TV is superb at its price range.,Best smart TV in economy price range.,B07RJQYL97

"On papers the product looks good. However, when you start using it, issues will crop up in series. I am regretting buying this tv as it cannot be called a smart TV. They claim many things, but not everything work as expected. 1) Cannot connect it to wifi- WiFi connection keeps on dropping every minute. You can't use this tv as SMART TV. I raised a repair after struggling many days thinking that my internet connection is not strong. It took 6 days for them to come and check after I raised the request. The engineer said the problem is with my wifi router as TV is not compatible with TP Link router (which is absurd, why would you sell a tv which is not compatible with most used router brand) even though my other devices are working perfectly fine on the network. To that argument, i tried connecting TV to my phone hotspot. Connecting doesn't work in this case also. When i informed the engineer about this, he suggested me to connect tv to ethernet cable to use SMART features (in this case I cannot cast from any other device). The other issue is they are not trying to resolve the issue. 2) They claim it has Google play store. Honestly, it is useless. There are very few app which are usable. Even Netflix is not available. 3) You can't chrome cast all the apps. It support only limited set of apps. Cannot cast Netflix. 4) Patchwall which they advertise as its USP is actually useless. I never used it and i don't think anybody is using it to watch anything. 5) Very slow in opening apps and booting up. Not recommended if are looking for a smart TV. Can work if you only want to watch cable TV. In that case you much cheaper option available.","Bad product, no service support. Don't buy.",B07T89Z35Z
"I got it (43"") in 20k during sale. Worth every penny. Only downside is that it doesn't have IPS panel even through its a full hd tv which doesn't make sense, I am not gamer but gamers deserve IPS panel when they are buying a full hd tv so 1 star less only because it doesn't have IPS panel because this same model has IPS panel shown Tech Singh on his YouTube but end users are not getting the same. Amazon prime and Netflix is supported and will be automatically added when you update to the android version 9 which is available, go to settings and check for updates. Those who need subtitles for watching movies should know that the default video player doesn't support subtitles so if you want to watch videos with subtitles you should install vlc player, just make sure that the video file and subtitle file has the same name, just open the vlc player and give permission to storage and all your video files will be showing in vlc app, just click on the video u wamt to watch and subtitle will automatically work. Next day delivery by Amazon even during big sale and same day installation by Xiaomi on delivery date. Kudos to both for this. Remember, keep ₹500 ready if you want wall mount during installation. That is the price for wall mount only, if you don't take wall mount then you don't have to pay anything and get the installation done as table top. This is initial review just wanted help to those who think that this tv doesn't have amazon prime and Netflix or that it doesn't support subtitles. More review will follow in due course.",Value for money!,B07T89Z35Z
"I'm so disappointed with this product and Amazon service both. Firstly the product description never mentioned that you need to have a WiFi router just near the TV for it to work. This TV doesn't work even if the router is Jus 5 ft away. And Amazon - I tried explaining this to Amazon customer care so many times, but the answer I got was - Amazon doesn't take any return in electronics, it can only fix only if there's is a techinical issue. Not directly, but they asked me to change the layout of my house & rebuild it to suit the TV. I'm done shopping with amazon!!",DO NOT BUY THIS. NOT FROM AMAZON ATLEAST.,B07T89Z35Z
"This is quick review after installation for those who are about to buy, will repost if there are other observations. To the point feedback: Dont think further go for it! Pros: TV supports netflix and prime video after update, side loading not required (check screen images ) YouTube after update works flawlessly Screen mirroring as expected (minor lag as with all screen mirror apps ) HD videos works excellent. 4k videos are a treat to eyes. Side loading of apps easy peasy task. Low power consumption 4star rated tv. Amazon service excellent (delivery & installation) installation team called 4 times to confirm after installation. Cons: Dedicated mute button missing (can use google assistant to mute by giving voice command). Restarts couple of time if software is not updated,wich means without internet it might give some trouble for basic users. Sound quality can go better with this type of tv. Google assistant can go a bit better as at times mic doesn't recognise the command. Some sideloaded apps not work as expected.

"I bought it in the name of smart tv and cheap price. I'm disappointed with majorly two points: 1. Poor picture quality. I had Full HD connection. And, the quality is superb on my another TV (Samsung smart tv). But, the quality is so bad that I confirmed from my provider whether the connection is running on HD! 2. There is no Amazon Prime, Netflix App support in app. And, they are promoting their shitty patchwall app. This TV is good for people experiencing their first smart tv and that too in tight budget. Else, dont go for this TV. Samsung is best in this business.",Looks like Windows XP in the era of Windows 10,B07T89Z35Z

"This is extremely pathetic led and in fact a fraud. This MI Led is of extremely low quality and my new TV images are blurred with no sharpness. I have been following up with Amazon to get the issue resolved but they are simply not taking any interest. It would have been better if we buy such items from shops. Also the servicing company has scheduled 5 visits but never came even once. This is totally crap. Post buying , neither Amazon nor MI nor servicing company will take interest in ur woes.",Horrible LED. So not fall for trap. Very bad service from Amazon.,B07T89Z35Z
"-Ordered on Sunday, -Received on Monday. -got a call from the installation agent exactly at the time on product delivery. -30 min from then the agent came home and installed the TV 43"" with a new wall mount(charges 500rs). -checked all the features and they all work perfect -casting is just one click away. cant have Amazon prime :( got to figure out a work around can download some apps (like VLC, etc) through play store Overall good TV.","Happy, Satisfied, I Recommend this product",B07T89Z35Z
Hi guys I have purchased MI TV in the month of July it's been 4 months now for the first time now we got crash error ...posted crash pictures ... requesting MI team to check and improve Thier product service ...now there is no chance even to return ..so PPL check and buy ..just don't see cost reduction ...also see reviews peropely and go for it ...o would not recommend ...buried for 22k and now we have issue...BiG no to this MiTv,MI TV crashes after 4months usage ..BIG NO TO MI....WASTE OF MONEY,B07T89Z35Z
"Here is my first week experience! Got the tv on Thursday and the Amazon installation was scheduled for Saturday. The installation happened as scheduled. On the tv, oh it takes ages to load. Mine took 1hr to load only then i realised i had to turn on the power switch. The screen yeah, when i push it... it goes beyond gilgit baltistan and towards Karachi. And then i decided not to push so far. Regarding free content i decided to contact Sundar Pichai to see if MI tv purchasers can be given free access to everything premium. Still waiting for confirmation from him. And besides all the above my MI Android tv works just fine. A brilliant tv for 22k that i paid. Can connect my laptop and mobile device to it. Loading time was not even a minute. Just set it up with your Google account and then navigation is a breeze. This is my bedroom tv and absolutely good looking. Go for it and don't believe the many low ratings as rightly pointed out by one reviewer... they expect 100k performance from a 30k tv.",Works just fine!,B07T89Z35Z
TV is not working even is not restarting. It's being less than 18 hours I have been using it. And have major problem with WiFi it's not reconnecting if once lost connection. Please check the video.,Worst device to purchase .. not working,B07T89Z35Z
"Just unpacked and installed, however much to my dismay brand new remote isn't working! Have raised complaint but no concrete response even after a few days. Quality control looks like suspect as MI scales the Indian markets. Am not sure how durable this one is going to be. 29.10.19 After raising complaint the service partner landed up 5 hours late that too after bailing one day due to weather. Remote was not working and now Amazon has washed it's hand off asking to contact MI directly. Unless you are an extremely lucky person please don't buy this product on amazob",Remote not working and horribly amazing Amazon experience,B07T89Z35Z
"Value for money. Doesn't support Netflix so, you will need a firestick or you can use the built-in Chromecast. The TV ends up freezing at times when connected to Amazon firestick and we have had trouble with the TV not recognising the firestick device. We did the good old restart and it worked. I am sure there are better TVs out there but they are also more expensive so, it is up to you. Voice recognition is decent since it's android based.",Value for money,B07T89Z35Z
"Bought the MiTV 4A PRO 43"" during dussehra sale. I own a Micromax FHD LED tv (not smart TV) & an LG UHD tv. Here is what i felt after using the Mi TV 1. For the discounted price, it's worth the buy! 2. This tv doesn't come close to the LG one. LG costs higher. Both picture & sound quality is much better than MiTV. WebOS, even though has lesser apps than android, is much better designed & responsive than MiTV's OS 3. Patchwall OS that comes with the MiTV is waste. So is the remote, when comparing to LG's magic remote. So far, you might think this is a biased review. When compared to Micromax. 1. The FHD tag on Micromax is a sham. Even my phone screen looks better. MiTv has much superior video & audio than Micromax. 2. Had seen some users reporting about os complaints with the MiTV. I faced no such issue. Os lags alot, snail pace to boot up & update, but never unresponsive. I use only apps that i need, no junk apps are allowed to run. 3. Got the update to Android 9.0, along with Netflix & prime apps. Really worth the update. 4. Patchwall is a sham. Content is waste, not free also. Final verdict: If you are in a budget range, know how to use a smart tv, go ahead. Compared to my Micromax FHD tv, the picture is really superb. Micromax can't even get close to this quality. Compared to my LG, both are inferior in terms of quality, features & performance",A Smart tv worth considering,B07T89Z35Z
"It is very surprising that neither the Warranty card nor the User's manual was found in the box. The delivery boy told that this would be taken care of by Installation person as he had opened the sealed box in my presence. The installation person told that whatever is there in the box are the standard items supplied by the company. I would however like to say that whatever be the cause, I want the User's Manual as well as Warranty Card, which may be got sent to me at the earliest.",Missing User's manual and Warranty Card,B07T89Z35Z
Promptly delivered by amazon. Installation delayed and rescheduled. Awesome picture Quality. Sound very clear. Needs improvement Amazon Prime and Netflix not preloaded. Bluetooth is not capable of connecting beyond 6ft. 4k videos do not play Internet connection should be stronger than 20mbps for a streaming videos.. Overall good set with reasonable price.,Smart tv loaded with good features,B07T89Z35Z
"The TV is good and it has all the features that are needed in a smart tv. But the amazon service is the worst service. The installation services are not at all good. The agents will make up some stories for you to avoid the service. And these amazon people are so much supportive to them. I’ve bought this tv and the installations services are scheduled two days after the purchase. Nobody shown up. It’s better if you order it from flipkart. Amazon is not so trustworthy for large appliances, products are ok. But services are the worst.",Worst service,B07T89Z35Z
The tv is good and you will love it if its your 1st smart tv. But if you have already used some other high brand smart tv then u will find it just an ok type. The picture quality is good and is the only best feature of this tv. The panel looks very mediocre. The processing is slow. Takes longer time to start. Sound quality is good but it could have been better. I won't say its a bad product but at the same time its not that much good either. The price of the product justifies its quality but if can afford a higher priced tv then go for some other higher brand tv.,Price justified TV,B07T89Z35Z

"My TV arrived 2 weeks back. My installment appointments have been postponed by installer four times. They just give a lame excuse of not finding address, when hundreds of Amazon delivery agents could reach my house with out any problem. No one bothered to even inform me that they are not coming. Their appointments are meaningless. Everytime when I contacted Amazon service centre, they only promptly rescheduled the appointment. When I called them last time, I was told that it is MI TV's responsibility and not Amazon's concern. Further I was told that Amazon neither cares whatever review I submit nor if I stop buying anything from Amazon. Now if I get it installed from a outside technician, the warranty will be worthless.",Installation problems,B07T89Z35Z
"Good TV and I am happy with it. Picture quality is good, sound quality is resonable. Packing and delivry by amazon were as usual good. Voice recognition could have been a bit better but that would be nit picking. For those who have issues with Prime Video and Netflix not being included in the boquet, believe me, casting from the mobile apps for both of them works like a charm, tried it out myself. And for those who feel that casting is not an option, buy an amazon fire stick and you would still be better off from the ""overall dent in the wallet"" standpoit. Update - Nov 3, 2019 - In order to make things complete, Xiaomi has done an Over The Air update of the software which has brought both Netflix and Prime Video as part of the pre-installed apps. The software has also been upgraded to the next version of Android. As such, at this price, this is a steal !!!",You don't need to rob a bank for being smart...,B07T89Z35Z

"Pros: TV video quality is good. Casting worked very good. Cons: Streaming using android apps is not so good as it gets struck at times, but while casting using same apps everything works just perfect.

"Got a steal deal during offer period, after sbi card discount I got this led in around 18 K. Picture quality is perfect Inbuilt apps are performing absolutely fine Sound output is good. Service & installation :- One of the Most important topic for this TV. I have seen many people are complaining about the installation but trust me the installation team is very professional. They have given proper demo and clearly detailed about merits and demerits of this product. Now the performance, till now it seems like a great device. 4 star out of 5",Nice TV with good installation and demo.,B07T89Z35Z

Whereas at the same location, this TV is not able to load because of Internet connection issue",Not as expected. Wrong chocie !,B07T89Z35Z
I have returned this product within 10 days. I observed black marks on the screen. We must understand that Quality is cost..! You can't get the quality product at this price tag. Now I m using Samsung smart TV and its far better than MI. Thought I paid some extra to get this quality. If you are only focusing on cheap TV then go for it. Or else go for some branded names like LG Samsung Sony etc.,Good at price but poor in quality.,B07T89Z35Z
"Using since 1-2 months. Satisfied with the physical TV, interface, picture quality etc. However be aware of its serious compatibility issues. In short - apps aligned to MI/Android such as Hotstar, ZEE5 etc. work well. Apps not aligned to it such as Netflix, Prime Video, Airtel TV are a struggle: 1. These apps are not pre-installed which is not an issue, but they are also not available on the TV's Google Play Store 2. You therefore have to install them through a process involving a USB stick which again is something I can easily live with - but then they do not function properly. Netflix works but the navigation is slightly sub-par. Prime Video worked for a few weeks now it just hangs, have reinstalled and tried every other fix but it does not work on my TV anymore. Airtel TV is displayed inverted on my TV, not been to fix it no matter what 3. I also feel seriously cheated by the in-built chromecast. In my previous home I used to have an external chromecast device to which I was able to cast Netflix, Prime Video and othe apps from my Apple devices without any hitch whatsoever. You cant do that with MI TV's in-built chromecast - for many apps the cast does not connect at all, for others it casts with a poor picture quality. This has been confirmed to me as normal by MI TV's customer care Overall if you are looking to use the TV for apps such as Netflix, Prime Video, Airtel TV (and maybe more) I do not think this is the right TV - you will have interface, connectivity and compatibility issues. I feel cheated because I bought this TV among others in this budget for its in-built chromecast and similar features. MI TV now tells me that since these are compatibility issues and not defects I just have to live with them :(",Serious Compatibility Issues,B07T89Z35Z

Thank you Amazon for an extremely lovable deal. Wish to shop with you with such more deals. Tons of thanks!! About TV: After two days of usage, I'm happy with performance of the TV. The picture and sound quality is certainly upto the mark. After few months, I would certainly review the TV once again. The smart features are quite good. So is the case with the voice recognition facility. It's my first android TV and I'm satisfied with its performance. Cons: The demo service was not upto the mark. The technician was considerably negligent about the various features of the TV. I requested for the knowledgeable technician to visit but a teenager looking person was sent.

"I didn't buy it from Amazon. Was an offline purchase. The build quality is good and the display is very good. It supports full HD resolution. You can find the technical details anywhere on the net. The TV has 3 USB and 1 HDMI port. Works great to connect with laptops. It has Bluetooth so Bluetooth earphones and mouse , external speakers can be connected easily. Supports Amazon prime through third party apps. It's remote is uniquely designed to have only essential buttons as you mostly have a different remote for set top boxes. Using it since last 7 months and I have no complains. I usually use YouTube and Hotstar apps to view contents and it works perfectly. Only drawback I think is that there is no web browser inbuilt or in app store. One will not be able to browse web in this product. I have a old Samsung smart TV and it does have web browsing. Other than that I have nothing to complain.",Value for money. Great display and Chromecast supported.,B07T89Z35Z
"6 days after i purchased this 43in pro tv, beautiful vertical line is seeing on the screen. The os is too slow. Compared to the price, this can be adjustable. Always opt for extension warranty coz you badly need this. Edited later: After I contacted and filed A complaint in mi , they sent two people to check whether complaint was genuine or not and later they replaced tv and said i registered the problem within 7 days after installation so i got this replacement else they only correct the pblm of the old one. Btw i felt happy at last.",My first tv got damaged later they replaced. price is the only benefit,B07T89Z35Z
"Xiaomi’s products have taken the Indian market by storm. When it comes to smartphones, there is no other company which comes close to what Xiaomi offers in terms of affordability. The Xiaomi Mi LED TV 4A Pro is a good buy for someone looking to buy a budget TV in the Rs 20,000 price range. I am really happy for purchasing it got it installed in two days only. Great Smart features and picture quality of it impressed me totally, Voice recognition is also top notch! Thanks Amazon for this amazing product.

I Contemplated buying one of those cheap Chinese brand first but I had heard so many horror stories from friends about the poor quality and limited service availability that I eventually went for a premium product. I have a lot of product from Samsung at home and I am very happy with them so I went for Samsung. Sharing my observations from using it for a few days: The TV was delivered and installed on time without any follow ups. It is a top notch premium looking UHD TV with sharp picture quality Cannot be replaced by Chinese TVs. The sound is loud for enough for my room size and vocal clarity is awesome it has Dolby digital . I used the tune station app once- it allows me to play music While the TV screen is off. I some times pair my phone with Tv. Screen Mirroring work without any lag .,Samsung is best tv in regional prices.,B07T89Z35Z

Best Android TV u can get in this price range.. first of all there is no such brightness issue as reported by other users reviewing after 3 days of extensive usage. Cons- 1- for 1 instance i feeled some lag in switching from android tv to patchwall 2- u need to be careful with remote just 1 miss hit button can exit Ur movie or even power it down..( we r used to infrared) 3-port should be in side not at the back because once u wall mount. it become very difficult to access if u dont have enough space in right side of the tv. Pros - 1- viewing angle angles are really great. 2- i think pathwall is bettr then ANDROID tv if services of android is used together with patchwall 3- picture clarity is tooo good. 4-value for money product 5- installation technision is just too good and friendly even its his off on 26 jan he came and installed the tv nd gave proper demo.. Just go for it ..it is the best available product that u can get in this range ANd dont forget to buy extemded warranty along with it .it will become very handy during any mishap with the tv.,Brilliant,B07T89Z35Z
One of the best tv I used before the picture quality and the sound quality is soo good this tv give us great experience and this is a smart tv so you can watch any thing you want as mi is a great brand that you can trust but the one problem is that this tv is not ultra HD and Netflix and Amazon prime doesn't work in this without fire stick other wise this is perfect tv,Delightful,B07T89Z35Z
The tv is good and you will love it if its your 1st smart tv. But if you have already used some other high brand smart tv then u will find it just an ok type. The picture quality is good and is the only best feature of this tv. The panel looks very mediocre. The processing is slow. Takes longer time to start. Sound quality is good but it could have been better. I won't say its a bad product but at the same time its not that much good either. The price of the product justifies its quality but if can afford a higher priced tv then go for some other higher brand tv.,Price justified TV,B07T89Z35Z
"I have taken this 43 inch smart TV from Mi.

So much of professionalism and experience. Entire demo was given by the engineer Note : Black level will be slightly high ( slightly greyish) in dark room .

This is the 2nd 32 inch smart LG TV I am buying the first one stopped working after 3 months some issue with the electrical adaptor. After 3 months of no response from LG customer care I thought its easier to buy a new TV. Made the mistake picked up the same TV thinking the previous may be one off. The new TV LG customer care came and installed the audio was not working they blamed the tata sky set top box and said get it fixed. Now tata sky technicians came and validated that their settop box audio is perfectly fine on other TV and this LG 32 TV has a issue. Big disappointment 2 times on amazon two times defective model was shipped. Not sure what's the issue but definitely makes online shopping experience bad. Totally disappointing please donot by LG products they seem to have overgrown the trust they once held,LG 32 smart TV Avoid!!!!,B07TMFQMJC
It is probably the best budget smart TV around with a brand name. I have been using it for about a month now and my thoughts are below The best thing about this product is it's price but don't buy it if you are looking for a premium product. The low points of the product is highlighted below 1) Sound quality is not good if you are planning to place the TV in the living room I will suggest you add a speaker for clarity 2) the smart features are not impressive with no screen cast support for Android .The web browser UI is not ideal but manageable. 3) the remote for this TV is not best built with a very long sequence required to increase brightness or picture quality. Also the absence of YouTube button is also not convenient.,Good product for it's price range,B07TMFQMJC
"I bought it for 16500 from Amazon during offer period Amazon 5/5 Picture quality:5/5:lg brand is known for its lot of new software such as WEBos .. Sound amazing: 20w speaker gives u a chill effect Smart :connect with Ur mobile and play hotstar,mx player and movies from Ur mobile to big screen BEST BRANDED UNDER smart TV under 20000..go for it.LG never disappoint..AND MAKES UR HOME GOOD",Amazon well done..LG.BRAND THAT GIVE TOUGH COMPETITION FOR SONY,B07TMFQMJC

Hotstar, jio tvand soni liv shall not be operated but it may be through google chromecast bcz m not sure",Good tv with bad OS,B07TMFQMJC
"I have like the TV and smart tv option. It's been very user-friendly for me, but I am little disappointed with the description .It was mentioned as magic remote but received different but picture quality is not up to the mark of sony picture quality.",Lg Smart tv bought it very best rate.,B07TMFQMJC
"I'm using it from Feb 3, 2019. This is a very nice product from LG. This product is a 2017 model and that is why price is very reasonable. But I think It hardly matters whether it is 2017 or 2018 model. I asked at LG showroom, they told the price will be around 28k. But I got it from Amazon in 21k. Smart features are working nicely . Youtube app, Netflix and Amazon Prime app is working fine . But after Tv installation these apps might ask for upgradation. So You need to updated all apps after connecting wifi or LAN connection. Web browser of this TV is quite good. U can open any website through this browser. But might take little longer to load any video streaming website!! I'm using my broadband wifi and it has connected properly. LAN cable option is also there. TV has a good user manual app installed in it by which you can easily find out how to use this TV. this is very helpful. Miracast screen share option is quite effective for this TV. You need to install an app from Play store in your Smartphone. And need to register your TV with serial No in this APP. and then you can share your mobile's galley, videos etc in the TV. But remember you can't able to copy files or folders from your mobile to TV. Only You can share the screen. This TV does not comes with a magic remote! Overall very good product. I would recommend this product.",Nice Product . Smart features . very good Picture and Sound quality!,B07TMFQMJC

The product is good but instead supplying magic remote as promised only ordinary lg remote was supplied which is not fair by company like lg,Good tv,B07TMFQMJC
"After a month of usage Installation was free with wall mount & was installed the same day evening. Display was brilliant more like Sony. Google Chrome browser helps you to browse everything like PC. Not android but good comparatively good. With apps available on Lg app store. Comes with just one year warranty as we buy online. If stores outside it comes with three years by default. Supports many video formats like mp4, divx also. With extra 3 to 4 thousand you can get voice activated remote control in other Lg model as this was just an normal remote no Google assistant",Best TV,B07TMFQMJC
"Oh the choices we have these days. From HD ready to 4k, thanks to surplus cash in hand, zero interest EMI and Chinese manufacturing. And what do we have in hand?

So when 576i source is amplified into full HD (not even 4k) in our large screen chinese imports(or Indian assembles), what we get is immersive, yet immensely dull rendering as you watch it from a distance. That's where 32"" tv comes handy. You gotta sit close, like 5-6 feet and that's the best compromise. Those who rely mainly on SD content, get this. The upscaling to HD screen is much better than in the other brands. Choice is between 'dull, large screen' vs 'small(32), crisp images'. I went for the latter. Yes, picture is sharp. Bright. Vivid. By that, i mean nothing life-like. Life is dull and boring, remember? We apply instagram filters to make it rich, it's the same here. You can dull it all down if you want in the settings. But yeah, the tv is a joy to watch. Much have been berated about the sound, I don't find room to complain anymore. The modern human want the most powerful car with the highest fuel efficiency. He seem to believe that he can get everything- use your brain for a while- a compact package would only give little room for the speakers, so how much loud can they really be? It is good for a bedroom or a small living room. There's lack of bass, but audio and music sounds much clear. There is also a clear voice mode. Think of it as an expanded phone speaker- serves the purpose. There's ample smart apps and there's also a HDR mode even for non-HD content- not sure what it does to the picture, haven't tested enough. Power consumption is a humble 45W (this at full backlight/contrast, will go down if you reduce it ) so you can run it on your home UPS all day. There's less heat from the back. TV starts within seconds and displays the hdmi input (dth box, in my case) which is so much of a + over the cheap android tvs. Pen drive plays hevc content too! That's a +. Of course, impeccable quality with HD and full HD content. Around 15k INR, what you get is a 50% higher priced LG than the TCL, Vu equivalent, but what you also get is the peace of mind of owning a brand that actually provides a warranty service. It's like buying a toyota. You would only realize the premium paid in the long term ownership. It's small, but it's a joy to watch.","for SD only content, this is more than enough.",B07TMFQMJC
I have 50 inch Samsung purchased 2 years back for Rs 80000 and Sony Bravia 32 inch 5 yrs back for Rs 35000 and now purchased this TV for Rs 14999 with 1000 cashback in amazon pay.

Remote is ok, typing is difficult but using mobile remote (LG TV plus app) makes the job a little easier. Wall mount has been delivered free of cost by installation person. No papers given for 3 year warranty. Installation process may be given to a third party by Lg. So your installation experience will depend on the type of person coming for installation.

"One of the best buy! Quality is very nice, smart tv option works smooth. Rating are below as after 7 months use Picture quality 5/5 Smart tv 5/5 Looks 5/5 Sound quality 4/5 ( sound quality is good only the problem is less bass and less volume.",Rating are below as after 7 months use.,B07TMFQMJC
"Got it for 17889 excluding another 3k in cashback. Worth the actual price though. YouTube and Amazon Prime works too good. Mobile screen casting also works good. Best thing IMO would be you can operate the same with LG Mobile app, WiFi connected and doesn't requires IR blaster. Best viewing distance would be 6-8 feet away. What didn't work well for me is the Amazon coordinated free installation. I had to call LG and get it installed, however that happened within 24 hours for free. Personally didn't care about HDMI port as said by others as casting from mobile phone works. LG does sends you software updates if any and it gets I stalled without any pain.",Worth the actual cost,B07TMFQMJC

"I waited for a week to review this product just to see how it works out and I have to say it is great from all ways. I received the product one day before expected date, and the LG service eas so spontaneous at my installation request that they sent the mechanic in less than 12 hours. Speaking about the TV, it is magnum at the price of its offered at. Picture quality is to good and navigation is good. The only drawback is the absence of Hotstar App as well as a magic remote as it becomes a bit difficult to control a smart TV without a Magic Remote.",Magnum Budget SmartTV,B07TMFQMJC

"Got this in Rs.13,999 + 10% OFF at https://amzn.to/36Rayck & extra 3 years of warranty. Its the best budget smart TV by the best brand. With IPS panel, video quality is perfect. Sound quality is fine. But, still need to add speakers for clarity. Happy with its smart features. color, brightness, contrast like things are good. Viewing angle is fine. It doesn't have Android so you have to manage to increase brightness or picture quality. But YouTube app, Netflix and Amazon Prime app is working fine. Miracast screen share option is not quite effective. But can't ask for more in this price. Product is excellent for tight budgets. PROS and CONS from my side though: Pros: 1. Overall performance is good. 2. Picture and Sound quality is great. 3. Build quality is good. 4. Connectivity and Smart Features are working properly. 5. Easy access to Netflix, YouTube, Amazon prime, Hotstar and lots of other apps. 6. Colors rendered are pretty well. 7. Screen mirroring is fine. Cons: 1. Only one USB port given. 2. White or Black colors on screen are not pure whites or blacks. 3. Refresh rate is just 50hz so feels lag in sport videos or gaming experience. My advice is to go for TCL 4K UHD - https://amzn.to/2P4JPm8 if you can afford more for even more performance classy looks and quality.",14K for LG 32 Inch is Good Deal,B07TMFQMJC

"Good things. are Best Clarity + good sound not best. smart remote is best Bad points very dirty OS (operation system) very slow. Not good application update. Even there are less application. On LG TV ads and site they show different application but due to area continent it restricted. Why there are giving such false info. Mobile sharing is not best. micro-cast mobile technology is poor. smart remote is good but no used. No screenshot taken, even live tv is not enable. After a 2 years Display stop working. thank to TaTa sky TV is on mobile to. Now LED or LCD is not for longer run. I will recommend OLD technology we say DUBBA technology. hahaha. Well another recommend no smart TV with HD ready technology. we can use Amazon fire stick for youtube or app. it will fill smart tv apps. only required USB and some good ports on TV panel.

"This is a best buy by LG in this price point. So here's the overview: 1. Picture: The picture quality is good with different option available. If you are using a set up box, then it would be better if you upgrade from SD to HD. 2. Sound: The sound from the TV crisp and clear and 10W speakers are loud enough for your home. No need of buying additional soundbars or speakers. 3. Smart Features: It is a WebOS TV and not an Android one therefore, inspite of 1GB RAM there are no lags while switching between apps. Connecting to WiFi and external sources are very easy and work very well. The internal storage here is around 500MB which is enough for normal use. The TV can be easily connected and controlled with LG TV Plus app with screen casting and content playing features ( wherein you can play photos, videos and music directly from your phone). 4. Magic Remote: No magic remote is provided with so no magic remote means no voice input that means you literally have to type everything (which is a bit boring!!!). 5. TV Apps: The TV comes with pre loaded apps such as Netflix, Hotstar, Amazon Prime, ErosNow, Hungama etc. Well there is no Youtube and Spotify but you can easily download them from LG content store. And you need to update all apps when you start for the first time. You can even uninstall pre loaded apps if you want. This is the best TV if you are just upgrading from your age old CRT's to LED TV, as there is no point in spending more money and buying a non smart LED TV. Prompt delivery by Amazon and the same day installation by LG.",Best In This Price Point,B07TMFQMJC

"Excellent TV . Am already blown away. Will write a detailed review in few days. After 1 day usage . 1. Display is terrific. 4k with hdr makes it awesome . Blacks are brilliant and brightness are good too . 2. Sound could have been better. Not that it is bad but lacks some kinda punch. 3. UI is pretty simple mostly Google . Smooth and easy . 4. Netflix, YouTube and few apps are inbuilt but missing Amazon prime video . Though you can cast it by inbuilt chrome cast . 5. Looks are great. Thin bezels 6. Remote is okay . Very minimalistic but does the job . You can control the TV by smartphone though 7. Major advantage of this TV is Google assistant . Works like a charm everywhere and you don't have to type . I got the TV for 17k . Exchanged my old TV for 13k and extra 2k discount for SBI card. Can't ask for more. It was a steel deal on Amazon festival time.",Awesomeness,B07TNVR737

Ordered on 2nd October and tv is is delivered on 4th and my old tv was taken in exchange offer .The installation was scheduled on 9th and to my dis may the installation person didn't turn up.All the excitement that would have been there had installation taken place on the scheduled day has evaporated and there is no proper respone.The mail received threatens that if rescheduling for installation not done then it will be cancelled.I do not know what they mean by that.The long gap in installation and missing the installation date in not pardonable. They should open their eyes at l east now.,Inordinate delay in installation of TV and not turning up on appointment day,B07TNVR737
Hd channel viewing is good.sd channel viewing not good,Not bad,B07TNVR737
I have purchased this TV in Dusara Sales. TV is simply Awesome with extraordinary features. You feel great view with only HD channels. Only missing thing is Amazon Prime. I am eagerly waiting for that. Probably it may include in next update as per TCL announcement. You can enjoy 4k videos only if you have Gud internet connection. Please review all comments and compare with other brands also and then take decision.,Simply Awesome,B07TNVR737
"Have to say , This is awesome! The 43"" TV is the variant which I bought , I use it a lot for Netflix , Prime and Playstation. Tried running few things in 4k (Youtube Videos) it was amazing! Before going to Pro's con. Keep in mind this is a budget 4k TV. Pro's :- 1. Fairly Cheap 2. Android 9 is intuitive and easy to use , You need to download Apps like Hotstar and Prime. 3. Superb brightness and multiple screen settings to adapt as per your need. 4. FIFA is a joy to play on this! 5. Alexa integration is good but there are flaws. 6. Doesn't feel bulky. Cons 1. Alexa integration cannot turn on TV! But can turn it off. 2. Takes 5-8 seconds to start after switching off the Plug. 3. Voice recognition has issues when the TV is playing something. 4. Could've done with a better remote design (Perhaps removal of Netflix button?) Overall , the TV is bang for buck , you get what you pay and for as little as 21k (Bought with Discounts and all) it's absolutely amazing. I have not added the volume component since I don't mind having a lower volume.",MVP TV!,B07TNVR737
I got this for 32k during sale n i believe at that price I have no rights to complain about anything..worth the price ..n trust me even if u guys buy it for 40k its worth..all ends r sorted m pretty satisfied,Steal deal...,B07TNVR737
"I had purchased a TCL 65 inch TV on Amazon on 29th, September which was delivered on 4th October. The installation was supposed to be done on 6th through a booked slot during the purchase. No one turned up on 6th. After repeatedly escalating the matter on Amazon no one on the TCL installation department has bothered to respond. It has been 4 days past the due date and finally I have got the TV installed on my own. The service is really poor. Amazon was good enough to reimburelse the amount but the issues faced were too many. Now looking at the installation service I am afraid that if something is to happen to the TV I am expecting to face a lot of issues. The TV on the other hand is value for money. Really happy with the TV so far..it has built in android so need for a fire stick as well.",Poor installation service provider. Good Tv.,B07TNVR737
Speechless! Awesome job TCL hats off... deal is more worth than every penny. Picture quality is very good. Audio quality is very good. App opening takes little time but it's OK. 4k video are playing without any interrupt. I can rate this TV 10 out of 10.,TCL 43P8 Review,B07TNVR737
"The TV is great for the price. Got it on Sale during the Durga Puja. One thing though is the support of TCL. No one came to install even after 5 days of delivery. I had called TCL several times before I decided to mount it on the wall myself. Now after 2 weeks the technician calls me up and says he would like to come and install it. Nevertheless, Amazon delivery was super fast. Ordered in the evening and got delivered next day afternoon.","Good TV, super fast delivery but support could be better.",B07TNVR737
Product was delivered on time. Got installed by service person promptly. Is working well. I think as sd channel picture quality is not that good as what we see in showroom...it's nice but not sharp. Amazon prime installed through the play Store and working well.no issues as mentioned by others till now..today is first day ... only thing where not satisfied is that expected very sharp images and pic quality like seen in showroom.. may b i m wrong. I don't know if the tv is at fault or not. After 3 days..i can see dead pixels on the screen. Picture quality is really bad. Requested replacement...,Request replacement.,B07TNVR737
I bought this tv on 30th September 2019. But today 18th october we got some white line in the right side of the tv. We required replacement of the tv.,White line in the corner of the tv,B07TNVR737
"It's a wonderful tv in 43 inch segment. Thanks to amazon and TCL. 4K experience has been amazing, its fast and efficient in terms of performance. TV comes with wall mount and also free service installation. Didn't try gaming yet. Decent storage and RAM are available. Unfortunately, I didn't get my free service installation yet.

"The television may be a good product for a budget price. But even after purchase, for 10 days no one turned up for installation. I waited to the core and finally after couple of week returned the product. Very poor service provider (TVS-E). They act like they don't have any connections with amazon if we contact. Think of post purchase service. It's gonna be a nightmare. So simply returned the product.",Good product worth for money. Very poor installation service. Suffered a lot and returned,B07TNVR737
Writing review after 2 days use. Timely delivery (thanks Amazon) and stellar support on prompt installation (thanks Amazon and MV Enterprises). TV boots up fast and the picture quality is breathtaking. Chromecast built-in is an added benefit and works super fast given my 50 MBPS internet connection. Been binge watching 4K movies and shows on Netflix over weekend and very happy with the purchase. I intend to write detailed review after sometime teati g Xbox One and STB.,Excellent Product 65 inches LED 4K,B07TNVR737
"The tv i got was already used by someone else the stickers were not there, wall mount missing in the package. I bought the same tv outside i could easily tell the difference and the other problem is Tv screen goes black with audio still on after few minutes. The installation guy didn't show up still and i cant get replacement till i get installation done. And the best one is there are no returns for the product. Stupid product with stupid installation service and as far as Amazon goes this is their worst product by far and my worst experience on amazon",Plenty of problems and amazon sucks for sending an used product,B07TNVR737
"Tcl 43inch 4k tv is amazing, picture and sound quality is awesome as expected. It's a very good buy in smart tv segment.",Awesome picture and sound quality,B07TNVR737
"The picture quality is great. The micro-dimming technology sometimes feels weird. I guess you turn that feature off though. Apart from that the tv is amazing. Great picture quality, fairly decent audio quality. Tons of features as it is an android tv. Takes almost a minute to turn on, but i guess thats with every android smart tv. Even though i have the apple tv connected, but its great to have amazon prime work on the native OS. I cant say anything about the voice recognition as i have not used it yet, and dont plan to use it in the future either. For 30k the tv is a steal.",Great Picture quality. Decent Audio. Amazon Prime works too.,B07TNVR737

"Coming to the product , it was good but there was no response from the TCL company and the installation was done from our side . Delivery boys said that technicians will be arriving for a installation and a demo but unfortunately Sorry . It's almost a week completed. But the product is Good and the clarity and the sound system was Awesome . Only disappointment with technical Assistance.",Nice but need a assistance,B07TNVR737
Mine has issue with software i guess. It's unable to play 4k content from HDD and none of the files working from usb port. It plays video file just voice no display. Display turns into green. All this started after 15days of purchase and I couldn't able to return also because return window is closed. Now I have to struggle to fix this issue. Not worth it. Better to by good brands even though it is bit expensive.,"What we pay for that's what we get, not worth it.",B07TNVR737
"Have been using for eleven days. So far it has proved to be a good product. Though Amazon fixed an installation date ten days after delivery, I called up TCL and it was installed the very next day. The only issue was that the installation agent's technician was in a rush and finished the ""demo"" in 5 mins asking us to read the manual for the rest. The manual is OK but not very good. Of course, I should be able to get a hang of features not yet used by us such as mobile phone mirroring and voice instructions into the remote but that takes time which I haven't yet been able to devote. I guess the ball is in my court only.",More than value for money.... it's a steal.,B07TNVR737
"Being smart android TV, there must be all apps. Jio TV and amazon prime video apps are not compatible with this. Please provide a solution to install or access these two apps on this TV.

"Ordered during diwali sale. Bought for 46k or so. Received promptly. Installation was done by team of 2 people in professional way. Been 2 days since i have started using. 2 stars less since amazon prime video is not yet supported. Customer service could not say by when will it be supported. Using Google Chrome to use it for now. Smart tv not having natuve support for such leading platform is bad. Have bought TCL 49 inch earlier, ljked it and hence bought 1 more but this time smart tv. Picture. It's very good if watching 4k video. Your internet speed should be good for 4k video. Eae it will pause due to buffering. HD channels should be good. Haven't yet connected tata sky hd+. Difficult to compare with others sincebmost showrooms tune tv which they want to push in best setting mode. I am happy with pictures so far. Audio Typically LED tv have bad audio output due to lack of depth i. Speaker. This TV has better audio compared to my 49 inch non smart TCL TV. am using SONY RT3 sound bar so dont care about tv audio. For decent audio, spending 10 to 20k on homr theater orbspund bar is highly recommended. Other Bezels are really slim. Looks great. Option of turning off white light strip when tv is off is well thought, since i dont like such lights during night especially if you use it in bedroom. Need to figure out how to play games with gamepad. Wall mount is very good and sturdy. Go and buy it since its best value for money.",Good value for money. Amazon prime not supported,B07TNVR737

"Intially I was very apprehensive of buying a TCL brand, but after doing lot of R&D, I decided to go for TCL 43KP8. Let me start with the packing, it was intact and was pleased to see, the way they had packed it. I brought this from my local dealer, because this model wasn't available in Croma and other big retailers. The local dealer helped me installed it the very next day. Its just been 2 days, however, so far its been impressive. I'll directly move to Pros and Cons Pros - Good clarity User friendly Awesome sound, you dont need a home theater after this good features as well Cons: little bulky from behind slow response time when you move from one channel to another Cant think of any",Feedback for TCL 43P8,B07TNVR737
"Bought this amazing 55 inch TCL TV P8 on 15th Oct from offline market , got it for 30k net including cash back, must say its excellent for its price, was delivered the same day and company technician came the next day,wall mounts, table top clamps, Manual, warranty card and audio video cable was included. My First thoughts - 1.Excellent Picture quality , plays 4K content flawlessly, good colors n brightness (4.5 out of 5) 2.Good clear sound, could be slightly better but cannot ask for more at this price, quite loud, at 30 volume it was sufficient for my 200 sqft living room (3.8 out of 5) 3.Android 9 with Netflix and YouTube preinstalled, installed Prime video, hotstar, zee5, altbalaji and others from Google play store, all worked fine , no issues there (4.7 out of 5) 4.Good build quality , voice command work perfectly, all necessary ports though location of those could be better (4.0 out of 5) Overall 4.4 out of 5, excellent value for money , in offline market we get 3yrs warranty instead of 1.5 yrs offered here so keep that in mind.","Excellent 4K 55inches TV, Good Buy",B07TNVR737
"Long Term Ownership: I would not really say long as I owned it for 2 years now. The TV functioning is good, no complains from this android TV. The TV panel started to give problem from 18-20 months. It would not show display immediately when turned on. Now the display itself is completely gone and need to be replaced. As you know the display is 80% of the cost. So it is not really a ideal scenario. Please consider going for a branded TV where there is warranty on the display as well.",Long Term Ownership,B07TNVR737

"I have bought this TV on 13th October 2019 for Rs. 47999. The picture clarity is too bad. This is 4KUHD TV but the picture clarity is equal to the LCD TV of the SONY. Because I have used Sony LCD TV for nearly 8 years. TCL 4KUHD screen is not TFT. Therefore the tubelight in my wall is appearing in the TV screen. Buy this 65inch TV if u have very big hall in ur house. The quality of the non HD channels are very worst. The audio quality is not good. The audio output is not gives 5.1 speaker channel digital effect. This TV gives the picture clarity of Projector based videos. We can't expect the picture clarity of Samsung, Sony TV. Don't expect much when u buy this TV.",Bad picture clarity,B07TNVR737

"The Picture quality is good for the price of the TV. Now, for the problems I'm having. Not playing 4K content on Prime video. Only plays 1080p. Also, the app is slow and I had difficulty loggingnin to prime the first time I opened the app. I had to reinstall the prime app in order for login screen to appear. Also, my Bluetooth Xiaomi audio reciever keeps losing audio whenever TV is left idle for even a minute or when i switch over to another app. The TCL tcast remote android is buggy and it is impossible to enter text using the remote app. Edit - it’s December and prime video app has now disappeared from play store. It wasn’t very good before as it couldn’t play 4K content. Now, the app has disappeared altogether from the play store. Now, I have to side load the app to install. The TCL customer care keep saying prime video support will come after OTA software upgrade. Initially, it was supposed to come in October-end. It’s December now and still no OTA software upgrade which will bring prime video 4K support. Very disappointed with the software experience.",The software is buggy. Prime video not playing 4K video,B07TNVR737
"I never see this type of Fake product which is sold among the peoples . No picture Quality, No Bluetooth Connection, T-cast disconnected immediately while play the videos , 4K video not support . First this is not 4K TV. TCL cheat the peoples in the name of 4K UHD. Not worthy. This is completely LED tv only not 4K or UHD .

"*Best TV in 40 inch category* I was looking for a 40 to 43 inch branded Smart TV and decided to settle for 40N5200. First of all, it's 40 inch size, which is not much of difference from 43 inch. Secondly, I was getting a branded TV of that size for under 30K. I got this on an EMI of Rs 1500 only. I had explored online as well as in few retail stores - no significant brand sells 40 inch Smart TV at this price! The Picture Quality is superb with amazing colors, brightness and details. The sound quality is very good with amazing vocal clarity This TV is extremely easy to control and clutter free. Another thing that stands out is the pre-built VoD apps such as Netflix, Prime, Voot, Hotstar, Zee5 etc. This is a Smart 7-in-1 TV that can be used as a laptop as it has built-in Microsoft Office 365 which I don't think any other TV offers. Plus, the TV comes with a Tune Station App with a visually stunning equalizer which is a big plus for me as I am a music lover. Screen mirroring works smoothly without any lag. It has Bluetooth capability so I can pair my phone with TV and listen to music as well. It also has a special feature called LiveCast which helps you broadcast live on the TV from anywhere in the world Overall, this is a wonderful buy if you are looking for a 40 or 43 inch branded Smart TV.",Best TV in 40 inch category,B07W5GNXKH
"The television is decent enough considering it's price. Sound quality is neither great not bad. It is good enough for a television but for music and all you have to get additional speakers. Remote is very compact so you will need time to get used to it. Amazon delivery was awesome. Why not 5 stars? 1. The customer support team of Samsung says our service center is closed on Sunday without even trying to get the facts. When I called the service center from just dial, they were open and did the installation on Sunday. 2. The app store is not rich and sort of forces you to use apps of Samsung's choice. 3. You can not use Amazon music, wynk because they have gana app preinstalled and you can not uninstall it. 4. They have useless apps like cric mania and sunnxt which takes a lot of memory of 1 GB RAM that it offers. The sunnxt offers some bengali, Tamil and Telugu channels no Hindi, no English. Why on Earth will I want to have it in my TV ?? 5. Come on it's a 1 GB television the least you can do is remove these bloatwares.",Samsung forces user to use apps of it's choice.,B07W5GNXKH
"This TV is a Must Go option considering the Price and the Specification. If you guys have the Volume problem, go to settings and change the sound option to Optimized mode so that the sound will be good. Over all best TV at this price range. Just go for it.😍😍",Best TV at this Price range,B07W5GNXKH

Samsung has always delivered quality product. Market Value of China product is cheaper but still i had chosen samsung tv. Amazing picture quality as well sound too. network connection is good as well as mobile connectivity is also amazing. Service of amazon is great as per written as particular time. Installation of tv is done at the same day of delivery.,Highly Recommended,B07W5GNXKH
"It's not worth I think I was using Philips 39 inches he led , Philips was better than this wrong purchase. Installation is big fraud like I thought wall mount is included. But it's not included once I got TV I am flooded with calls for installation. After so many call's I ask one to come and he knows there's no wall mount. I asked will you provide he said if its rotating one 1600 (in online it's cost is 350 which it can hold up to 50 inches TV) . See how big fraud it is ,they are just utilising situations. Asked bill he said no sir we will not provide bills. Amazon you should look into this.",Installation fraud,B07W5GNXKH

"I like the Picture Quality. It doesn't disappoint. Blade Runner 2049 looked amazing. Sound Quality is adequate for my room. No complaints. But, my problem is with the samsung pre-installed apps. They are very slow to load and im not a huge fan of the interface. IMO, one should go for a non-smart Samsung TV & get Amazon Fire Stick. Fire Stick is uber fast with an amazing voice remote. That would have been a better option. Overall, its a 3.5/5 star Value for Money product. Its good. Thats it.",It's GOOD.,B07W5GNXKH
"I'm writing this review after nine days of buying the TV.. And in these nine days, I wrote down what I understood about this tv.. PICTURE QUALITY - Just one word.. ""Fantastic"" .. You can watch clearly from any angle of your room. SOUND QUALITY - Many people are saying the tv sound is low .. but it's not true.. the sound of this tv are awesome.. If you are not satisfied with the TV sound, Then go to Settings and click on Optimize .. then you'll hear the difference.. CONNECTIVITY - Here's the big thumbs down.. I'm not satisfied with this.. The TV can only be connected to a Samsung phone for mirroring screen, Use Pre- installed Gallery app , Samsung account etc.. even I can't connect the phone, with USB cable.. very disappointed.. You must have a Samsung phone for use these features.. You can connect bluetooth from your phone easily, and also Hotspot for Watch YouTube etc.. 100000+ HOURS WATCH TIME - I think it's totally wrong.. because.. when I went to open a NETFLIX account, Then it's asking me for subscription money.. It's not just on Netflix, even it's happening in Prime video app.. I don't know why.. Overall the tv is awesome.. at this price point this tv is value for money.. you can go for it..",Read this before buy this TV,B07W5GNXKH

Good sound quality acoustically speaking with surround effect. HDMI connected volume is lower as there are two remotes for volume adjustment. Eg dth remote and tv remote.Picture quality improves with adjustments of back light and contrast but can be better. Connects to the internet. One can play YouTube videos directly. Plays amazon prime videos. Connects to usb mouse which can be operated while on internet. Connects to iPhone to play Apple TV videos. Apple TV app also plays directly.

"I am a little disappointed by this product. I have a Samsung series 6 from Jan 2015, and the picture quality for that is significantly better than this. The viewing angle is the major problem. When viewed at an angle greater that sixty degree or so, the Colors aren’t that great. That’s the biggest disappointment.

I will never recommend anyone to buy any Samsung products due to their worst customer service. Thanks",Samsung Hater,B07W5GNXKH
"This is a great TV for those who need premium quality on a budget. The display and sound quality is perfect for the price that we pay. The design of the TV could have been made better in my opinion. The picture quality is crisp and clear and the 40 watts speakers(the user manual says so) provide clear and ample sound with mild bass. Once connected to a wired or wireless high speed internet connection, the TV brings out its full potential and offers a plethora of content. Additional apps can be downloaded from the App Store which includes Apple TV, Facebook etc. Screen mirroring is a really useful feature on this TV. I couldn’t find out any major flaws after using this TV as for the price that I paid, I am completely satisfied with what this TV is providing. I don’t think that one needs a service technician to install the TV if it need not be wall mounted as all the instructions are clearly mentioned in the user manual. I did the installation and setup on my own and it was as easy as one, two, three!! We were using a 32 inch Samsung FHD LED TV for the past 9 years and is still working impeccably. But, we decided to upgrade to this as we wanted to have a smart TV since a long time & got this on a really attractive offer from Amazon. I really hope that this TV would serve us well like it’s predecessor!!! I would completely recommend this TV to anyone on a budget looking for a VFM TV.",Perfect For Our Family!!,B07W5GNXKH

The Product is excellent and value for money. The Smart features are extraordinary and user friendly. Sound quality is decent and feels like working with a normal Sound bar. Picture quality is good and require few settings to be done to get in depth clarity. Once done you will get extraordinary picture quality. Overall the product is good. After Delivery I received a call from Samsung and Samsung Associate reached my home to deliver the Wall Mounted Frame and fixed at free of cost which included in the price .

Recently bought this TV on great Indian sale. Product delivered within 2 days and very next day got call from local Samsung customer service and by evening they installed it but they have not given any demo. Display and sound quality of the TV is good. Only few apps are installed in it. So if you need more apps more features I recommend you to buy Amazon fire TV stick. SD channel quality is also good if watched from 10 ft distance. HD channels are delight to watch. Also got confirmation message from acko team regarding additional 1 year extended warranty. Screen mirroring via honor phone is quick and easy.,Nice tv at affordable price,B07W5GNXKH
"TV has a good picture quality, bright and crisp. Dedicated button for prime video and Netflix on remote is very useful. My previous TV was 42"" and this TV being of 40"" appears very small, although the difference is merely 2"". Wall installation mechanism is very good. Sound quality is OK but on feeble side. You have to keep sound mode 'optimised' but still volume of around 50 would be OK in a 2BHK and around 70-75 in 3BHK sized flat. It would have been good had Samasung provided 'surround' mode or sound 'equalizers'. The deal was a real catch for me 1000 off during festival season and 2000 off for SBI card offer, total 27000-3000 = 24000/-.

I have 3 days time now and need to check tv functioning is good or not ( if installation is done). Not expected this from Samsung care Update: Installation was done and all features in tv was good.

"I bought this tv last week. I can say this tv is value for money for some one who is looking for a decent 40 inches FHD smart tv less than 25k. Excellent picture quality and sound quality is definitely above average. I saw negative reviews of sound quality. That is totally ridiculous. This model has all great features that one can expect in a smart tv. Most of the apps like prime, zee, Netflix are compatible. I am assuming hotstar can be downloaded. Pros Pricing! Samsung has kept aggressive pricing for this model. HD Picture quality. Definitely better than mi 43 smart model. Smart features. Samsung brand value, service and 2 years warranty (panel only). Cons Sd channels picture quality from dth is not great. One should go for hd channels. I am using Tata sky. I recommend to upgrade to hd subscription if a person uses dth more than smart features. Only two hdmi port. Three would have been better for people who have gaming consoles and speaker systems. However serious gamers like PS4 users. Go for 4k Models.",One of the best 40 inches FHD smart tv less than 25k,B07W5GNXKH

If we are talking about its installation..it usually done within 48 hours of delivery..in my case they came to next day after delivery and did the Free installation with wall mount..nd No Charge taken for the wall mount stand ,they did it Free of cost...Amazon delivery nd Samsung Service was Awesome. Overall I will recommend this TV in this price range.",Best TV in 40 Inch,B07W5GNXKH

I was not going to buy a traditional TV cable (settop box). Needed a smart TV with netflix, amazon, youtube & HDMI playback. This one just works out of the box for me. PROS: - Good enough picture quality - Most apps work flawlessly: Netflix, Amazon Prime, Youtube, etc. Good optimisation by Samsung - Dedicated netflix & prime button is really helpful - Enough sound for my need. - Good wifi connectivity. I use this TV on home wifi completely. (Don't have or plan to buy Cable.) - Can directly cast my OnePlus 6 to this TV which even uses the sound from the TV itself. Overall an easy to use TV which just works out of the box. CONS: - On receiving realised the energy efficiency of this TV is BEE 2-star. This is not mentioned anywhere. - This seems to be a low cost LED panel to compete with the Chinese counterparts. Hence the lower price. But surely, the quality output, the samsung OS & apps totally make it a good buy at 25k for me.",Good TV I got at amazing price.,B07W5GNXKH
"Guys simply go for this TV without any doubts in your mind. Don't pay attention on any negative reviews. Picture quality, sound quality everything is super awesome. This is the best full hd smart tv in this range.",Super Awesome,B07W5GNXKH
"1. In specication Amazon told wall mount is free and technician will bring at installation time . But Samsung technician in Chennai porur area not giving wall mount . They are tell many reasons and argument with me . I asked wall mount , he told wall mount not suitable and it will need extra plug point . Finally he doesn't g provide wall mount .",Service is too bad at porur chennai,B07W5GNXKH

"TV is Very Good at this Price from Brand like Samsung..HD video quality is very good..sound quality is better than expected..just use ""Optimized"" option from Audio Settings for better sound..Almost all Video and Audio format's supported via USB including AC3 and EAC3 Audio format's..just AVI video format not supported..to connect PC or Laptop via HDMI you need windows 8 or above O.S ,7 not supported..I tried IT...",Nice and Very Good Quality TV,B07W5GNXKH
"Hi, Overall it's a good product. In Samsung after 5 series they have improved their connectivity things in terms of tech. So if you are basically looking for a TV with a good picture quality and connectivity as bluetooth, cloud, USB etc... it's one of the good option, and within this range of price it's best one. You will get decent sound, can't expect from a 20W speaker though. In terms of picture quality, well compared to 7 series models, have to admit it's back in race, but if you are using a good quality dish it's acceptable. through USB it's playing 1080p very clearly and doesn't support 4K however. as conclusion to consider this or not, you must choose it.. it's a go for it with in that price range.",Worth for what you spent.,B07W5GNXKH
TV is awesome... sound quality is best... picture quality is perfect!! Installation done as per my convenience though some parts are missing for mount installation!!

I have 6 years old samsung tv which currently working fine hope this new tv delivers the same!!,Read the feedback section..,B07W5GNXKH
"TV is not supporting 2TB hard drive. When you have HDD support, you should mention supporting drive size.",Hard drive with 2tb capacity not working,B07W5GNXKH
"We are very happy with the TV. The display quality is absolutely fantastic, as expected. The ease of installing apps makes it convenient. There are dedicated Netflix and Prime buttons which makes it fast. If the TV is connected to the Home Theatre system, the TV itself controls its ON/STAND-BY modes and volume controls, so you don't need to use any other remote control. You can even chuck the casting devices because you won't need them. Smart indeed. The on-board casting is super fast and the quality snaps in from the beginning- no need to watch pixelated nonsense for the first few seconds. Our only pain point is typing to search for something since there is no voice command.",A fantastic purchase,B07W5GNXKH
"Thank you Amazon India :) you made the festive season more memorable one. Also, installation by Samsung representative within 24 hrs of delivery, that also on Sunday is much appreciated! Since it's two early for writing complete review, I will update the same after 6 months.",Brand Is always brand!,B07W5GNXKH
"This product is best if you want to buy under budget. Also it has no cost EMI for 18 months. Pros: picture quality, value for money, sound quality, connectivity with mobile if you have samsung mobile. Cons: screen mirroring issues with non samsung mobiles. So if you want to buy a smart tv specially a samsung brand and if you are buying smart tv because you dam wanna mirroring your content from your mobile to TV. Other cons: you cannot install other apps. I tried hotstar but it does not install. Processing and refresh rate is slow. Amazon prime, netflix does not work in full hd mode 1080 px.",Great Product but screen mirroring issue with non samsung mobiles.,B07W5GNXKH
"I have been using Samsung Led Tvs since 2013 and they've been brilliant, on both the picture quality as well as reliability fronts. I used to be a huge fan of the Sony Bravia range until I shifted to Samsung which has since become the global leader in Led tvs. I was on the lookout for a 40 inch Smart FHD Led Tv for my bedroom and along came the Amazon Diwali offer! I bought it without a second thought and have been enjoying my purchase ever since. The Led panel is extremely bright and colourful and being a firm believer in calibrating my Tvs instead of using the default settings, I have turned down the backlight and contrast levels to 60 percent and set the contrast enhancer to high instead. The picture quality is excellent with Full High Definition material. The only gripe that I have is that the contrast levels of objects in the distant background appears a little washed out as opposed to the foreground contrast in this particular model. My view could be subjective and perhaps might be because 3 of the 4 other Samsung Tvs which I have are 6 series models which are supposed to have 20-25% better contrast than the 5 series models. I have the Tv hooked up to a mid-range Denon 7.2 channel Av receiver and KEF speakers and subwoofer, so I don't really have a need for outputting sound from the Tv speakers. However, the audio quality is good as well (for an Led tv) and there is a sufficient amount of bass. Vocals are clear and the treble is crisp without being fatiguing. At INR 34,000, discounted to INR 25,000 for Diwali, the Tv was a steal, considering it's obvious quality and brand value.",An Excellent Tv at a brilliant price,B07W5GNXKH

"Delivery was fast but installation & demo part takes approx 6 days.I choose the slot but guy didn't came and completed the installation process of its own on its app.Installation part is not done by 1+,they had given installation to Amazon, Amazon had given to Cloudtail,Cloudtail had given to Qdigi,Qdigi had given to another co.Guy who came to me didn't know how to set correct picture?They only know how to hang TV on wall else nothing. 3.5 mm jack is missing.Colour is better but not the best like Sony.SD channel quality is very poor,HD channel quality is poor.4k quality is good.So,if you have budget go for Sony for the best display and service after sales.If you don't have budget go for budget TV at least you will save money .If you can wait for at least 1 week for installation & demo part you can go for 1+ TV as installation co will say they are overloaded in this festive season as they have to install other company TV's also.2nd execuse will be 1+ TV is new so they don't know all about demo part.Kindly check full hd and SD picture quality before buying any TV as 4k content is not easy available in the market.",Worst installation & demo process of 1 +tv,B07W5QZQ45

Pros: Brighter screen with vivid colors Android TV USB type chargeable TV remote Loud & clear sound Cons: Poor upscaling for SD content HDR content looks poor as of now Unavailability of Netflix as of now No Table top stand provided Edit: The software update has fixed the HDR issue which I was facing earlier, Netflix isn't available yet.",A ideal TV for binge watching millennials,B07W5QZQ45

"Being a loyal OnePlus customer since OnePlus 2, had great expections from the TV. So much so that I was amongst the 1st customer to buy the TV on the 28th of September and much to my pleasure the TV was promptly delivered on the 30th. However since then the experience has been pretty horrid to say the least. The installation slot was assigned on the 2nd of October at 10 am but the technician didn't show up until 3 pm, understandably that the technician are busy due to prime sale, I didn't pay much heed. The installation didn't take place that day, admittedly due to my own reservation. Finally after calling and pleading the technician again and again the TV was finally installed on the 5th, but much to my horror, the TV had a crack on the display. Upon taking up the issue, the Amazon team agreed to replace the TV immediately. But to replace the TV the technician has to file a report on the same and because my initial installation slot was on the 2nd, it expired. I was assigned a new slot for the 7th. As of today I am still waiting for the technician to report the TV to be damaged so that I can get a replacement. Given the procedure, even thought I bought the TV on the 28th of September, sadly I won't be able to experience it before the 12th of October. The defected tv is just sitting in my living room since the 30th and just hurting my eyes everytime I look at it.",The review is more to do with service rather the quality of the tv.,B07W5QZQ45
"There are dead pixels on a brand new tv. Called customer care multiple times since last 3 days, no one responding with concrete solution, just buying time. I have my return window till 10 Oct only, Please return or replace. Update: Got the replacement now, and is good so far.",Dead pixels on the TV,B07W5QZQ45
5 Star for OnePlus TV as a Product. 2 Star for the installation Service. TV definitely is a great buy. Great Quality and Dolby Vision. All you can see in different youtube comparison videos. I had options either to go with Samsung Frame of OnePlus. I choose OnePlus because do not want a dedicated Art TV and samsung art TV is loaded with bloats. I myself compared both in person now I see they are almost similar. Game Of Thrones final episode on both the TV is not perfect but better than many other TV in the price range of under 1.2 Lakh. Though OnePlus is a bit cheaper than samsung frame quality is a marginally above Samsung. Sound is great on Q1 and I do not feel reviewing it as installing a separate soundbar with sub woofer is what I prefer. Pros: - Good Price Range. - QLED panel outshines everything in your living room. - Android Mobile Apps APK sideloaded are cropped towards left. (something they may need to fix. Cons: - No Cons for TV. - Amazon service is pathetic. They denied installation at my pincode and I had to go with many troubles for getting it installed locally. (it goes away from buyers pocket),Amazing TV - Poor Amazon Service,B07W5QZQ45
"Any one getting pink screen? TV has major fault of showing pinkish colour. Tried resetting TV many times. Got a defective piece. Left Half the screen was black. I must be the one in first 5customers of this TV in my town, got the tv in prime sale installed even before it went on official sale. Had such a difficult time with Amazon to get it replaced. They took 11+ days to get it replaced. That's after 7-8 hours of overall phone calls to Amazon and one+ call centers . it was quite frustrating experience. Everything that is expected from this TV is beyond expectations. All clutter is gone from my tv set. Most imp, this TV got I build sound bar with amazing quality. This helped me get rid of all wiring and devices that were required to get good sound from flat TV. You need only one wire that's power cable if nt using any hdmi source. Picture is amazing. Adjusting colors not easy. Still Having trouble to make color calibration work effectively with my ps4. Internet connectivity is amazing Adsusting sound is not easy. No preset sound modes. Remote is small sleek and useful. But not very responsive. It takes time to get response back from TV. Remember!!!! TV screen is very very very delicate. Be careful if you plan to relocate. Installation people don't know much about installation. Stand beside them to check if they follow instructions that came with TV.","Best quality picture, sound, internet and remote",B07W5QZQ45
Day1: This z my first smart tv so unable to compare with other tvs..but this QLED was awesome...enjoying Edit1: I got a defective product...the picture is showing some pinkish/reddish showing other than actual colour.i need to change the settings daily for this issue,Waiting for Netflix,B07W5QZQ45
display and sound is stunning,Awesome quality,B07W5QZQ45
"The TV is exceptional, the sound quality amazing. The thing that lets the experience down is the remote, having no mute button is especially irritating and a long press on the volume down key doesn't serve that purpose as usually it does in Mobile devices. There is also no source button, and the tv always to defaults to the Android screen. Not the last source input screen. To watch TV for elders in the house, it proves to be too much to handle. Image processing is weaker than Samsung or LG but I am hoping software updates might improve the algorithm. HD and UHD content is good but sd is horrible. (Alexa or Google assistant aren't able to mute or change source like apple home kit, adding that function might greatly improved this experience) Verdict: no brainier if you have only people less than 50yrs old in the house. Side note: The installation experience was a nightmare, that is more of reflection on Amazon home services who sent one person to do the entire installation of this 55inch qled. After a lot of calls, they sent a decent engineer and his sidekick very late in the evening. Almost ruining the entire day. That's all. I can add more photos /videos but I am recording with my phone so the excellent sound quality might not be reproduced.","Everything is great, but the remote...",B07W5QZQ45
"Did not like the TV at all. go for Samsung LG or Sony in similar price range to get all the apps running falwlessly. Very limited apps available, Netflix not available. Neither am I able to cast Netflix from my OnePlus 6t phone. Picture quality is far better when same app being played using fire stick compared to native apps. Native Prime video app also sucks. Expected much more from OnePlus, the playstore contains very limited app, almost of no use. I had a 4k TCL smart TV of cost around 30 k, I felt this TV is not doing better in any ways. The sound quality is better, but one still need good sound system.","Not at all like a OnePlus product, totally disappointed",B07W5QZQ45
"I booked the TV on the first day, just believed in OnePlus brand. But its a big letdown from them for their loyal customers. My TV have defects and I have been following up with customer care many times to sort that out but in vain. Problem: Whenever put the TV to standby from live channels and power on, it doesn't goes to live channels directly but it goes to apps page and you have to use your TV remote choose the input and then you have to use the settop box remote. Similarly, power off the TV should power off/standby the settop box as well , but it doesn't do. For both of these options are available in TV , but it doesn't work for my TV. Customer care team doesnot have any knowledge about the TV , everytime they say they will come back with solution but it never worked but they still close the case. Remote is too small to hold and have delicate buttons. It is difficult to keep it safe. Rest of them are fine.",Many defects and poor support from customer care,B07W5QZQ45

Pros: + Brilliant display + Sleek rechargable Remote + Excellent sound ( I decided not to get a sound bar anymore) + Very thin bezels + Easy remote on any android phone Cons: - Non-pro version doesn't come with a table top stand - Default wall mounting stand gives very less space behind the TV - Don't search for more Cons 'cause there are none,"If you are looking for 55"" TV, go for this one",B07W5QZQ45
"Pros Good design Great SDR performance Good audio quality Handy smartphone control app Cons Disconcerting build quality Poor viewing angles Mediocre HDR performance Silly remote design No AirPlay 2 High price For that price, you are getting a television with good design, good SDR performance, and good audio. The mobile app is also handy and offers a few more features than what we normally see in these apps. Unfortunately, the build quality is concerning, the HDR performance isn't impressive, the display has mediocre viewing angles and uniformity issues and the remote is frustrating to use.

"Ok guys so, first of all, let me tell you that I was totally confused while buying this tv. There were a few concerns in my mind: 1. This brand is a well know brand in Mobile but it's their first TV, So is it safe to buy ?? 2. I am getting 55-inch tv ultra 4k at price like 35k, so should I invest 70K in TV and get the same 4k tv? 3. Should I wait for other brands like Sony, Samsung, and LG to decrease the Price of their costly TV and buy them? 4. Ok if I want to buy One Plus TV, should I buy 70k one or 1 lac tv? Answer: 1. Yes, it's right that this is Oneplus first TV but I think we should decide whether to buy this or not by seeing the feature, component, and equipment which they have used on TV. After all the equipment matters more than who assembles it. If you see the specification and component used Like Panels screens speakers, all are very good and of high quality. So definitely this TV is a very GOOD TV. It's just awesome. 2. Now if you are comparing this with TV-like MI and TCL etc around 30 - 35 K budget then u are totally wrong. These low-end tvs are not providing high-end parts and components in the TV as one plus tv. After a year use these low-end tvs start getting slow and lags bcz there are no updates given by service provide on an old tv. These service provided launches 2 -3 tv every year and they forget old tv. Now one plus clearly told they will give update upto 3 years min. so that means this tv is not going to be slow or have any software issue. 3. If you want to wait then you can wait. But let me tell u something these giants tv company if they reduce the TV Price then also they will not give high-end specs. they will reduce the feature like instead of 4 HDMI 3 HDMI, sound output will be reduced from 40watt to 20 or 10 watts and many more things. 4. If you ask me, you should buy 70 K tv not the 1 lac tv as it has only soundbar extra. Many of you will already have the soundbar /speaker in your home or even you don't have, you can buy them at lesser price in some offer. I don't think spending 30k just for the speaker makes sense. Plus, its a motorize speaker so every time u switch on tv it comes out and so on. It is bound to have wear and tear in the future. But again it's up to u what u want to buy. Pros: 1. Sound 50 Watt ( Dolby vision and Dolby atmos certified TV) 2. Picture quality ( QLED Screen is just awesome.) 3. Oxygen OS/Play ( it is so smooth like a hot knife on butter) 4. Build Quality 5.Remote (awesome remote, trust me you won't miss mute button on this remote as many are telling in youtube) Cons: 1. I am going mad in searching for one con on this tv, but I haven't found anything yet. If I find anything I will update my review. Watch this space for more update.",BEST QLED TV. Trust Me!!,B07W5QZQ45
"My overall experience with this TV Update after 1.5 month: 1) Received new replacement remote in about a months struggle and it is working ok and not charged since 15 day. 2) Experience with oneplus service was worst amazon is still novice in managing warranty claim of product. 3) I don't feel the purchase of this TV was worth even after receiving discounts. I should have gone for Sony or VU as this one is somewhere in middle and considering service support and cost premium it is not wise to go with this product. Update after 14 days: 1) Oneplus don't have there exclusive warranty service provider for tv. 2) The agency they have hired for service are expert in installation (actually mounting on wall) and cover other Chinese brand also and know nothing about TV. 3) Twice placed the warranty claim request on amazon platform. First time no one came. Second time I called amazon twice and pleaded to send technician for I was assured that my claim request will be processed on priority. Finally technician came (late anyway) with drill and hammer in the bag and said he knows installation only he played with remote for sometime asked to call amazon again which have already done. If this would have been a local seller or any other established tv brand I would have definitely managed to get service. 4) For those who don't know - warranty claim for this product can be done through amazon app and not directly by oneplus so Amazon is equally responsible for warranty claims. I am worried that I am stuck with faulty product and oneplus and Amazon don't have ability/service providers to provide warranty services for TV. Review after 5 days use: a) Poor product QA, the remote is faulty and loosing charge completely in 10 Hour. I even struggle to turn on TV as remote battery gets drained and oneplus app start TV only if it was not powered off or shutdown was not done. It can wake it up only when TV is in sleep mode. b) Boot time is on lil higher side when compared with my firetv stick. App loading and switching is faster. c) Sound quality is good compared to any other LED tv, you will not feel need of sound bar unless you are use to home theater system. d) Picture is bright and looks good but doesn't match the SAMSUNG QLED or Sony. It is good far cartoon as color are little over saturated. e) installation experience was very poor. Multiple time amazon customer support made false promises for sending someone for installation but no one came until 12 days. Got it done from outside and got installation checked from amazon technician when he came. f) Installation is simple and when you switch on tv for first time you need to follow similar procedure like for new smartphone. g) Amazon need to train delivery staff on how to open bigger TV box and show TV to customers at time of open box inspection for delivery. There are plugs given near bottom of box which needs to be removed and box is taken out but delivery staff tried to pull out the TV from top of box and my heart came in moth as they were struggling and TV was heavy. I had to guid them on this.",My overall experience with oneplus Tv - Not recommended for purchase,B07W5QZQ45
Display is too good than sony Trilluminus display. Sound quality is very good with dolby atmos.,Very good display,B07W5QZQ45
"Hardware wise, the TV is all good and all. The picture quality, even the SDR content looks pretty decent on such a widescreen. But the software as of this date is at an okay level. They need to work a lot on the coming updates, like adding Netflix, being able to change to video quality in prime video, Miracast (unable to connect my laptop wirelessly to the tv), no data saver mode, etc. When music is played at louder volumes, the base feels muffled, not punchy. So yeah, if these problems are addressed soon, then it's a perfect tv",Is it worth the hype?,B07W5QZQ45
TV is good .... however installation partner VFcare is extremely unprofessional...will not install on time ...had follow-up multiple times. service engineer Did not provide me receipt for wall bracket ..,Installation partner VFcare is not great,B07W5QZQ45
"I bought qled q1 pro the minute it was on sale. So far loving the sound quality with its 8 speaker setup. The HDR content's performance is not as good as I was expected. I experience lag in HDR videos with breakage in sound. Also, there are some bugs like mute command is not responsive via Google assistant. The remote also would have been better if it had separate buttons for play , fast forward and rewind like in Amazon firestick remote.

"Trusting OnePlus and Amazon I ordered this product of such rate and now it turns to be my worst choice to get OnePlus's very first TV as it's not at all good with its Android software as it goes to all black screen after sometime of watching which makes it just as much irritating, we have to shut it down by guessing where the cursor would be and then again restart to watch something and then again after 10 mins it goes to black screen. And secondly it's just tooooo delicate which makes the product just not that much handy but a product to be kept in showpiece that hell yeah we have a OnePlus Android Smart QLED TV which doesn't even work properly. My homemaid was cleaning the desk under the TV and her elbow got in touch with the screen and here it is, the big crack appears on the screen. And when complaining to the company, OnePlus says that they don't know why this is happening.. might be some error in panel you have got get your panel changed for the issues you are facing and which will be costing you around 80% of the actual price and also the company can not do anything but I have to concern my problem with AMAZON as they are responsible to fix the issue , I mean what does this brand really want from us?! AND WHEN TALKING TO AMAZON GUYS,THEY TOLD US THAT THEY CAN HELP US BUT TELLING MY PROBLEM TO ONEPLUS MIGHT GET ME SOME HELP. It feels as if I am no one just left in the middle hanging and both the companies standing on either sides and laughing on the situation. Seriously this is mind harrasment for me as I am facing taunts everyday from my family about what an amazing investment I have made. I WONT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO LAY HIS HANDS ON THE PRODUCT.","0 in customer support, 0 in the quality of material used to make this product. Too delicate",B07W5QZQ45

"Dark spots appears on the TV. Unable to cast my 1+ mobile onto the TV. Remote is too minimalistic. Watching sports is a total put off. Judder & frame skipping while watching sports and some content. Auto volume reduction does not work as advertised, we'd have to manually reduce the volume. Coloured patches appear on the screen while watching 4k Content. Hoped a lot better from 1+.",Not worth the price tag!,B07W5QZQ45
Worst post sales experience. Avoid buying one plus tv . They won’t give proper post sale services.,Worst installation,B07W5QZQ45
"This review is just my opinion in layman eyes Pros: 1. Display is next level at this price. Need to watch HDR videos to experience the awesome display.. 2. Very user friendly remote app, they have tried and taken mobile remote to next level. Very easy to type. 3. Sound is very good and i don't think you need to go for pro version unless and until you have that budget and you want that fancy sliding speaker. Speakers are loud and clear. Dolby Atmos vision and sound works really well . Even in full volume no much distorsion. 4. Very bright and vivid display. 5. Beautiful, thin and beezles are ver small. 6. Official Android means almost all necessary apps available. Infact I felt that DTH is not required any more 😀 7. Looks MEMC was able to deliver smooth videos for most contents. It works. Cons. 1. When watching normal contents from DTH (SD and HD) needed some effort to adjust picture modes to watch comfortably. It took me time to adjust to watch comfortable. But you can maintain two picture modes with different setting and change when required. This is because high brightness is utilized to produce vivid sharp image for 4k contents but for normal videos display will turn too bright and you need to reduce backlight and brightness. I think this is something that OnePlus need to address in next updates. 2. Need to buy a flexible wallmount otherwise port will not be accessible. Flexible mount costs close to 3k. 3. I found it difficult to link this tv to Alexa.i am still trying. But I am not worried much about this and can't be a deal breaker. This review is from a week's usage. I will update any further observation after a months use.","Excellent display and sound, Wow at first sight",B07W5QZQ45
"Bought the TV and as promised, it was delivered on time. Installation was booked for 3rd Oct but no one turned up while got calls to shift the slot to 18th and then 28th which I refused. Finally amazon cancelled my installation and therefore, I got it installed from the same technician but had to pay 1000. Picture quality is amazing but sound is mind blowing and that too of q1. Non availability of Netflix is irritating. Rather than echo dot, amazon should have given fire stick free. Only con is remote, not very user friendly. Same remote can be used for fire stick if u wish to use it for Netflix or any other app. Few apps like ndtv or jio cinema which runs buttery smooth through fire stick, start buffering on Tv app. As I got 5k amazon cashback and 10% sbi card cashback, its a decent deal. Because of installation issue, I’m giving only 2 stars",Installation service is pathetic,B07W5QZQ45
"It was a steal Deal for me to buy this TV worth of 6998 in effective price of 55k in sale:- Got 5k Amazon pay balance. Got 2k instant discount with SBI credit card Additional Cashback of 5k in SBI credit card ( total 10% of cost - 2k instant discount) Also got Alexa echo dot free of cost 😁😁😁 Thanks AMAZON!! Review of Oneplus q1 tv:- Pros 1. Sound is premium quality. Crystal clear sound with beats with just 25% of the volume. On tuning volume to 50% it fills the complete living room and is UNBELIEVABLE. 2. Though they haven't mentioned the brightness level, the brightness is superb and colors are rich. Quality you can compare to other Samsung Qled models that come in 1.2laks. 3. TV design is bezieless and is premium from both front n backside. 4. Processing is smooth. Cons:- Main :- Refresh rate of tv is only 60Hrz which very basic. Any Qled in market even starts with 100Hrz. 1. Netflix is still not supported is still big set back. However it has been promised by OnePlus for support by next month. 2. There are still few glitches bugs in software for example when you try to login to premium in Sony live app then on OTP page keyboard doesn't come so you can't login. I have reported this to OnePlus. 3. HDMI ports are at the back so if tv is wall mounted then it's really difficult to reach out there to plug in and out something. 4. There are not much options to play with settings. For example to chance picture ratio or zoom in out etc no options are there. Similar is case with colors and contrast..not much options to play with..pretty standard thing given. 5. In Sound( type of sounds are very few standard, surround, clarity). 6. Serial no of tv is at the backside and not even inbuilt in the settings-about. Am I supposed to take out the tv if I have to tell the serial nbr to customer care...OnePlus...what were you thinking? Suggestions:- In case you are confused if to buy Q1 or Q1 pro, No need to invest extra 25k in OnePlus Q1 pro, since sound quality of Q1 itself is amazing. Overall feedback :- Overall am happy with my purchase and it feels value foroney. Of course it's not the best TV in Market, however it's premium thing in price range of normal one.",My OnePlus Q1 TV review,B07W5QZQ45

"I have always admired one plus brand. But of late, it is turning more in to a mix of samsung and apple in terms of their bad traits. However, let me see what I have assessed in last couple days of using it. 1. 4k quality is great. But then you get this quality even on a cheaper TV. It just depends on the durability. Will it last. 2. HD is also good . Delivers what you need. 3. SD, upscaling is little laboured. I have seen much better upscaled picture with a samsung led 60k as well as a TCL or bluankpunkt (hope i spelled it right) 30k tv. So little disappointed. 4. Sound is good for a smart tv. One of the few positives. 50 watts but on q1 it lacks the true base. Q1 pro could do better, but thats 30k more. Not worth. Can always get a home theatre under 5k. 5. In-built apps are crass. Useless. Heavy and doesnt respond properly. Prime video is the worst. It takes on an average 40 seconds to load. Can you believe it? On a 1GBps speed from spectra. Netflix not available. Some of the navigations do not work on some apps. 6. Used fire stick on the TV. Bad experience. Tacky. Doesnt load properly. Requires restart. Not a good experience. 7. Limited apps available via play store. 8. Chrome cast doesn't work full fledgedly. You can not take screen shots. Even though having that option. 9. Google assistance is a saving grace. 10. No motion sensing on remote. Even a 20k TV provides motion sensing mouse remote. In simpler terms airplay not available. 11. Remote is awesome in its aesthetics. But lacks a mute button. 12. There are no physical buttons on the tv. So take care of your remote. Remote gone. Game khalaas. Naa....use OnePlus connect on mobile. 13. Unfair to not give the stand with the tv. Wall mount is simple but gives less space between. 14. Android tv.takes long time to load and restart. Definitely NOT a 70k TV. Go for LG or a smasung at that rate. Personally have had great experience with smasung always. I chose this because Samsung frame TV was out of stock. That was my 1st choice. And inwas impulsive. But lets hope we have a great beast of a performance hidden here. Let oneplus provide some sensible updates and suddenly all the hardwares are used to its full potential.",MUST Read Review.

Installation team worthless. No idea about the device TV sliding soundbar not working Lodged n numbers of complaints with Amazon. No response from them Going to file case in consumer forum. Please don't buy,Poor service support,B07W5QZQ45
Writing this review after using for week. Picture quality is very ok with local cable SD channels. CRT TV do much better justice in picture quality. So if you are going to watch cable this is not right TV for you. Why are sound speakers behind?? Due to this sound output is very low. It doesn't seem like volume is from 8 speakers. Very inconvenient spot for cable connection and pendrive. It is very hard to insert pendrive for wall mounted TV. Who knows how to connect with Alexa? Definitely not echo support team .no steps mentioned anywhere. delivery guy was in so much hurry he didn't want to give demo on how to operate . It is bit difficult to figure it out specially as this was my first smart tv Editing the review after using tv for 2 weeks. Pendrive slot is not working so pendrive not detected. The 1+ service is worst no response after multiple follow up in 10 days .they just informed that the case is escalated and on highest priority but know one know when the technician will come. Not Amazon not one plus is ready to take responsibility for service. What's the use of 2years warrenty when you cannot provide warranty service within 15days? Didn't expect this bad service response from Amazon and one plus. Please take the tv back and refund the money.,Only hyped - zero star- one+ chor hai,B07W5QZQ45
"Brilliant display. Good clarity. Amazon video not playing. No one cares for installation. Amazon care says Oneplus will & Oneplus says Amazon will. Finally I got it fixed by local carpenter. Heats up at bottom, speakers, even after 30-45 mins use. I think it might be a problem after 2-3 months, 2 yr warrenty will help afterwards.","No one cares for installation.

"At this price, it’s an amazing TV. Wondering if these kind of launches by newer brands will bring stalwarts like LG, Samsung, Sony & others to reprice their models sooner ... that’s what happened with mobiles!

"Before buying the TV, I checked many reviews by the so called experts. They all had great things to say about the TV with the only caveat being that the price seemed to be on a higher side . Hesitatingly (Because this was a new TV brought by ONePlus) I bought this TV and so far after a week of use, I don't have any complains or regrets. The quality of the TV is too good and has a premium look to it which you normally get in TVs with 100K+ price range. The Picture quality is awesome with many preset settings that can be amended by the user. But the best part of the TV is its sound system. Most TVs in the market have great Video quality but their sound system is so poor that one has to install a separate audio system with woofer to get a good viewing experience. With One Plus TV, we don't need any external sound bar. The Sound quality is awesome and provides a great viewing experience. The sound is loud, clear and versatile for different scenarios such as movies, sports, video games etc. The remote is uncomplicated with only limited buttons, but once you get used to it, it provides everything you need to navigate your way through. All in all, a great deal as far as I am concerned and I believe that OnePlus TV will provide tough competition to the established TV brands in the coming months.",A premium TV with Value for Money offering,B07W5QZQ45

"The One plus 55"" QLED TV is the excellent choice. The TV is best in terms of aesthetics, performance in both video and audio. The remote is cute and with USB c type charging which relieves from the pain of changing batteries. The picture quality is vibrant and and sound is very good Dolby digital and no need for any external speakers. This observations are made after 4 days of use. May be I will give additional feed back after a months usage. Me and my family are happy that we have made a right purchase. The wall mounting installation was done along with delivery within 45 minutes it was ready to use. Amazon did a great job.",Right Choice !,B07W5QZQ45
I had ordered my tv on the date of release and was shifting to a new home so could not open the box and check the tv. Today we installed the tv via Amazon installation service and there is a blue/green line on the left side of the screen and it disappears at times when I press the left bottom side of the tv. The installation person asked me to contact amazon. My return period is over and i am very much in trouble with my family now since they had asked me not to consider since the TV was new release from a new company. I am very much not able to answer them and my father is not happy to service a brand new tv. I am a very hard core OnePlus user(from OnePlus one) and i am very much sad about this incident. I request fellow community members to share their opinion and request some help from OnePlus if possible. Update 31Oct: I have received the replacement TV from amazon.in and the new tv is all good. A big thanks to OnePlus and amazon for helping out and keeping in touch in every way possible. The customer care was super helpful and friendly.,Tv screen is not working.

"The 55 inch QLED one plus tv comes in as a complete surprise in this category. The 4K ultra HD display along with 50 watts output, sub woofers and full range speakers gives an ultimate theater experience of theater at home. It has a hassle free setup process from delivery, installation and technical setup. It was delivered with couple of days of ordering. The installation was done on spot by delivery guys. The setup was very easy to follow. Just fire up the tv and you will be guided through the process to sync it to inbuilt wifi, syncing in youtube account and more. It's perfectly compatible with Google home and Alexa. We have both and we have tested the same. The remote which comes along the TV is also quite impressive with it's sleek silver design. It operates on USB charging instead of regular remote batteries which is definitely a plus. It has an inbuilt button of Google assistant, you can speak into the mic in the remote to control your tv. Cons: Waiting for the Netflix support. Doesn't come with a table top stand. Remote is very slippery.",My first Smart TV,B07W5QZQ45
"I am writing this review after using the product for a month now. Being a movie fan, I watch a lot of movies and a good tv is what I have always bought with latest technology. I have an LG OLED with me but I will not compare the both as there is a substantial price difference. Now coming to the Much awaited and hyped One Plus TV. The most important things in a TV now a days are:- PROS: 1. Picture Quality and Pixel Enhancer: The picture quality of this one plus TV at this price is reasonable good. Not as good as Samsung QLED but almost at par. If Samsung QLED picture quality is 100, then one plus QLED is 90. Picture enhancer is also good. As compared to a 4K TV, picture quality is worth the money. So * for this. 2. Sound; is good and loud but there is an echo in the sound. But again this is not a home theatre and for a TVat this price this is superb. So again a * for this. CONS: 1. Refreshing Rate; This is where this TV is not at all worth buying. The refreshing rate is only 60Hz whereas most of the QLED TV are 120Hz. Most of us will think that this is not an important feature but you can not watch anything if the refreshing rate is not good. What happens is that the movie and sound lags. For example there is a 10 seconds actual video clip. If you will watch this clip in your other TV or Mobile or laptop, each second will be played in exact one second. In one plus TV, because the refreshing rate is slow, what happens is actual 5 seconds are stretched to 7 seconds and the latter 5 seconds are played in 3 seconds. So basically at times the movie becomes fast and at times the movie becomes slow and gives you a pathetic movie watching experience and this happ na on continuous basis. So crux is, it’s a pathetic experience watching anything on this Tv. 2. Installation: Amazon home services have provide one of the worst installation service. No kidding. Verdict: because of slow refreshing rate, I would not recommend this TV at all. Go for a simple 4K smart TV or wait till next Diwali till Samsung reduces their prices of QLED which is going to happen.",SAD TV,B07W5QZQ45
"One word. Waaaaw!!! Just when delivered and out of the box, it was just taking me out of the world. It's an amazing creation. Just left stunned... All are positives.. No words to explain. Nothing negative I can see. Oooh OnePlus hats off to your Research & Development team. I am looking forward to see the futuristic products that will stun the world and it's not far away.

"I'm about to tell a story, so get yourself a bucket of popcorn. I being a fan of one plus phones, bought the TV within very first hour of launch. Received the TV without having any Idea of craziness this TV bought with itself. First the technician installed it tilted and when I reached out to complain about it, Amazon agent said One plus does installation while One Plus agent said that Amazon did installation. Later while getting swung between Amazon and One Plus installation fiesta I realised that TV panel was badly bleeding patchy white lights on top left corner. I quickly borrowed few eyes to confirm it wasn't just happening to me. Later I called in amazon to report and Pheww it was tough getting through to get amazon agent on call once I have touched ""return and replacement"" button. Call would either end abruptly or technical issues would happen just for that call(well verified) or agent couldn't find my order number. Finally I tricked a call through and somehow convinced for inspection visit. It was cool after that as technician on visit agreed about issue and approved exchange. 2nd TV arrived and not so surprisingly it was tilted at same degree in opposite direction this time and technician won the argument by huge support from other 2 helpers he brought along. Anyway main issue came as I realised all images being blurred on top edge of the element (text ot picture on screen) while they remain sharp on horizontal edges. This time I had to take pictures on phone and explain it in email(it's tough). The agent finally agreed but would only provide refund instead of replacement. Now, I might have been sickened and raged by these repeating quality issues but was spoiled by color production and gorgeous looks of this TV at the same time. Thus I wanted to get same TV without any panel issues(funny, eh?). Conclusion (seriously):: Yeah, It might sound like an exceptional case but it confirms the theory how one plus has jeopardized the quality control in rush to launch the TV. Also that services have been affected badly from beginning itself because of confusion between amazon and one plus to reach out in case service is needed. I'm left with 8 holes in the wall and 3k worth hole in wallet as bank won't settle EMI interests of 3k due to cashback deduction from refund money. Now as I contacted One plus they chose not to reply back. ***** Stay Away from this TV for now******","Bought it, returned it Twice nd I'm left with 8 holes in wall.",B07W5QZQ45
Tv Picture suddenly goes into Pink.. U can see in the video and pics attached below.. We need to restart the tv to get it back to normal amd after sometime it will again to pink Blacks are not deep black always.. Inbuilt picture modes are not calibrated well.. Cinema home mode is some what better Sound quality is not good.. No proper bass coming from speakers.. Inbuilt sound modes are only 2 and those are not good.. We have to select user mode and set all frequencies to maximum to get better output THE BIGGEST SOUND PROBLEM IS SPEAKERS IS GETTING AIR NOISE FROM SPEAKERS If we set volume below 5 we can hear air noise very clearly even in 10 to 15 volume also air noise is there Connect app frequently disconnectes with tv.. Much hyped Gamma magic function is not magical at all SD channels are not good to watch on this TV Overall Disappointed with OnePlus TV Q1 model Returned tv and got replacement but same problems repeated in replacement tv also..

"Please find photographs of tv in which you can find a vertical line left side of screen. This was found at the time of installing only and the person suggested to wait and it will disappear in some days. But I am finding the same problem and the line is not going. The installation person told that if there problem persists, the tv will be replaced with new one. In addition the color is turning into pink all of a sudden and because of that the real colors are appearing in different colors. If the tv is to be replaced please do the needful. All accessories of product are available with me and the same will be handed over at the time of replace.

"Great product. TV Quality is superb. It is a metal frame and QLED TV. Because of QLED picture is good compaired to normal LED. Blacks are deep and colout representation is also good. This increases picture viewing experience especially while watch films. Normal TV channels do not pixelate and can have a fluid viewing experience because of the inbuild settings. You can access these setting from the android setting menu, picture settings like MEMC, etc. Sound Quality is also great even with non Pro model. Packaging is very premium as expected from Oneplus.

Writing this review after calling atleast dozen times to the one plus and amazon because the picture quality is really bad . whether it is SD or HD . Really bad Product by one + and surprisingly one+ has nothing to do with the service or compalins because amazon is totally responsible for the everything after sales what I have told by the customer care of one plus. There is no window for return the product. When I booked a complaint for the product the guy came for the service who don't even know how to operate a smart TV because he is employee of amazon .

"I bought this TV a couple of weeks back. key things to focus on: 1) its a QLED and not OLED, and QLED has nothing similar to OLED, it's more like LCD interms of how the display is managed. 2) Over all packaging is great like cellphone packaging very neat and structured. 3) Getting TV to setup is easy but getting it installed is a challenge, it took me 2 weeks to just get it installed. 4) 2 star rating because the remote already stopped working , electronic devices it happens but the bigger issue is there is no support framework available to address this issue, one plus guys send you to Amazon support, regular amazon support sends you to Amazon special support, amazon special support asks you to talk to one plus and one plus again tells you to go talk to Amazon.Now stuck with a new TV whose remote does not work. Cellphone remote is a lifesaver but a non starter for my parents. 5) Decent sound quality, I have it hooked up with my Bose sound bar 6) No support for Netflix is a big negative 7) dedicated amazon prime button on remote is big plus for someone like me who uses prime a lot. Over all a good buy but no point buying it when it cannot be supported well.",One plus launched great tv but fails to launch equally good support for it.,B07W5QZQ45

"Master piece product.. Just go for it. My Reviews after 15 days of use. Pros. 1. Almost Bezel less screen . 2. Amazing picture quality only in HD channels ofcourse. SD channels looks average. 3. Supports Prime, Jio cinema app, HotStart, Zee tv and many more apps which you need to have subscription. 4.Super sleek Design fits in wall very well. 5. Dolby Atmos sounds excellent. 6. Clean UI of Oxygen. Cons Now these are my personal experience which may vary by user. 1. Very Sleek remote so one should be very careful while using it. Don't ever give it to small kids or small children else be ready to shell out more money if remote is damaged. Just to be safe i have got a sillcon cover for remote which is of apple tv , which will help protecting the remote for accidental fall and damage. 2. Being a sleek tv has very less or nill space from wall to tv, so please plan to install all cables n USB devices before you wall mount the TV. 3. OnePlus has to provide more with next models. a. Must Table Stand b. Remote cover preferably sillcon one. c. Remote should have a mute button , else elders will find it a big big miss and it's true as that's must from a usage point. Anyone want to buy a sillcon cover check out for Apple tv remote cover , which fits perfectly with OnePlus tv remote.",Must buy.. if you have really like one plus products.,B07W5QZQ45

I know I said it has good treble, but for some content it is a disadvantage. - Remote should have a power on/off button, mute button.",Great but Improvement Needed,B07W5QZQ45
"This review is after one day of usage! Bought this tv by trusting the brand which produces premium android phones and somewhere i was little bit worried ! But after using this trust me go for it!! Delivery was fast, Installation was hassle free and the tv got Installed at the time of delivery itself. Thanks to amazon and oneplus! Seriously it produced the best picture quality ever and the sound output was amazing!! I was just lost in it !! trust me i felt goosebumps while watching the videos in YouTube and prime video ! Just ensure you have a fast internet connectivity! Mine is 25 mbps nd it plays 4k in youtube and ultra hd in prime!! I am really thankful to oneplus and amazon for providing the best premium tv ever!! Guys its qled with dolby vision , dolby atmos and produces 50watt sound for just 70k seriously who does provide this!!!? All These years other tv manufacturers were literally looting us but now its Oneplus tv era(just like life after jio) hoping other manufacturers also make our money worth! Its like a fluid!! Very fast and smooth ! The only con i felt is that theres no button for settings (to tune picture settings and sound settings)on the remote and badly waiting for Netflix ! Just go with this and if u want to experience it before buying go to oneplus stores they r really welcoming nd helpful! And also if u have enough budget go for pro version but this one is no less than taht! Just wondering how the pro version produces sound when the non pro version itself is a BEAST!! One plus 😘 Just hoping that this would run without any problems and will last for a long!! Anyways its providing 2 years warranty its enough to trust this for some extent!!",AMAZING!! Worth every rupee!!,B07W5QZQ45
Don't buy this product from Amazon. My remote is not working and Amazonnis making us run piller to post. Amazon asked us to contact OnePlus and when we called OnePlus we are asked to contact Amazon. Today 16 calls between amazon and oneplus till not no resolution. Amazon wants us to open ticket on their app which is not working. Now we have no choice to sit and wait till amazon fixes its issues. DONT BUY FROM AMAZON.,Bad customer service from Amazon,B07W5QZQ45
"I dont even know if the product really works or not, coz its been 10 days i am waiting for installation service and TV INSTALLATION executive marked job complete without even visiting. Worst after sales service. ONE PLUS team shoild know that, no wonder what ever quality u are providing but your after sales service will make it a flop show. So please gearup and show some sense to your customers.",Worst After Sales Service,B07W5QZQ45

"One of the Best displays i have seen till day.. Have been using LED display for the past 4 Yr and always had challenges w.r.t Clarity and Light Adjustments, these issue is handled automatically. The only concer is the Sound , while the TV has 8 Speakers, i dont see the effect of the same, I am thinking of having my BOSE audio system reconnected. Other then Cripsness of Sound (used to on account of using a BOSE AUDIO SYSTEM), the TV is a GOOD Offer,.. Would surely recommend the same. NOTE: One more Hrudle i faced was,, since my TV was one of the initial Piece, the Installation guy had no clue on its Operations and i ended up doing R&D to find out the Functioanlity of each feature.",A Theater screen @ Home,B07W5QZQ45
"Well won't talk tooany technicalities as I am sure those who are willing to buy this piece of art must have browsed the YouTube like anything for the reviews. Of course with that said this is my first ever smart/Android (call it whatever you wish to) TV and I felt it was a great purchase. The instalation date was too late for my liking so after confirming with Amazon that if I open the box and the TV unit appeared damaged in transit I am entitled for replacement, however if there are issues related to the TV OS in that scenario the warranty would be applicable and not the replacement, then it's up to One plus to decide whether to replace or repair the unit. If you are going to do the installation on your own make absolutely sure and I say it again be absolutely sure you would be able to do it, else be kind to yourself and have patience for the technician guy to do the tedious job. The set up part should be easy, considering its an Android TV and the set up is similar to setting up your Android phone. The delivery guy while delivering the TV complimented saying sir you won't need to go to a cinema hall after this, and trust me when I switched on the Tele, it literally have me a cinema experience, the sound output is stunning. Yes as rightly pointed by several other people adjusting the Televisions display is a task but u should be able to do it as per your preference. All the apps work as charm, I am only a prime user so am happy with whatever apps are on the television. The HD channels are upscaled and look stunning add to that the crystal clear loud output soothes your ears. You may need to teach your mum, dad or anyone senior about the operation of the remote, be patient. That's all folks, take care enjoy your viewing.",Certainly deserves a 5 start rating.,B07W5QZQ45
"I must say, it's a very good QLED tv at this price with no doubt awesome sound quality from that 50W speaker and Display is good but not superb like Samsung. 1. Need a major software update to fix Some screen bugs like picture setting being forgotten. 2. Need to improve amazon prime video app. 3. Need to bring Netflix asap. Display needs more software updates to be flawless. I am satisfied so far but looking for more software updates to make it more silkiest.",Very impressive OnePlus TV with Software improvement required.,B07W5QZQ45
"I ordered this product on 2nd October 2019 and got it delivered & installed on 4th October by Oneplus authorised technician. I got amazing offers and the net price for the TV was only Rs 58000/-. (Rs 2000 instant discount by SBI + Rs 5000 cash back from SBI and Rs 5000 Amazon Pay Credit). If this was not enough I got a Amazon Alexa Echo Dot free from Cloudtail seller. The TV is worth every single pie you spent. I saw few other products like Sony, Samsung and TV which are almost double the price for this quality. No regrets buying this TV. Pros: Excellent Picture and Sound quality. Good build. Vast range of content on Oxygen play. Cons: Very poor viewing angle. Slippery remote. Unable to pair the remote with Airtel remote.",Worth every Single Pie,B07W5QZQ45
"Oneplus has assembled a good display, sound system and Android OS into a TV with a decent price tag. But the TV doesn't perform. The 4K upscaling is pathetic. Amazon Prime App is pathetic. Playing Full HD, HDR and Dolby vision content in this TV is a headache. The 4K up-scaling is too bad that even high quality full HD movies (played through HDD) are highly pixelated. When HDR content is played through Amazon App (No Netflix support as of now) the brightness levels fluctuates hysterically. In Dolby vision movies (played through HDD) video keeps flickering. The digital audio output settings are also weird. In digital audio pass through mode, no audio output is obtained through ARC. Curious to know why Oneplus has come-out with such a half baked product in a big market like India? Most of these issues are software isssues which requires quite a lot R&D. Sony buys LED panels from LG, and Sony's picture quality is better than LG's because of better software optimization. Don't think a novice like OnePlus will be able to do that, unless a proper R&D team is setup for this. Wait and watch for the next software update.",Half baked product from Oneplus,B07W5QZQ45
"Bought in Great Indian Festival with Cloudtail Amazon offer (5000 cashback to amazon pay + 2000 discount SBI + Eco Dot Free), For 60k it is a satisfying buy. Pros: Display QLED with great brightness and colors Design and look Software support Oneplus connect App (Wifi must be connected with same, no Bluetooth option to connect) DTH HD channel performance Cons: Remote: Missing some buttons like mute&..., It feels premium but, size is too small, till now no availability of remote separately to buy if lost (Price ??). Sound is okay and loud but, not a great factor to buy as they mentioned in the event (about Q1 model only). the software needs to be improved (Got 1 update on 29 OCT). Ultra-smooth motion is not accurate (Poor DTH SD performance) Ram is Okay with 3GB but Storage is only 8GB free after OS usage out of16 GB Summary: The main factor to buy this Tv is display, we don't have QLED TVs at this price range in India. For now, it is a good one for consideration.",Good Buy For Display,B07W5QZQ45
"Picture is un-naturally vivid and the colors seem un-naturally bright and sunny. Not only is there no Netflix app. casting Netflix via built-in Chromecast or airstream doesn't work either. Had to deploy an external chromecast. Sound quality is pretty good but not sure if it is significantly better than the cheaper model of OnePlusTV at 70k. Practically paid 30k or so extra for the stand, an echo for free, 5k cashback and some extra speakers that slide down when you turn on the TV. Positives are their Android works and is responsive unlike bigger TV brands like Sony, was able to connect Bluetooth headsets easily.",No Netflix App. Not great value for money. Questionable value of OLED on picture quality.,B07W5QZQ45
"I did so much research to finalize a TV, but heard about 1+ and waited for its launch, with reading about it and booked on Amazon sale, I was one of 1st few customers to buy. It's been amazing experience using 1+ right from the Design, quality and sound what not, it's a worth product in the market w.r.t QLED technology. One thing missing is Netflix, may be next update we might get it. I bought 1+ Q1 55 TV. If 55 inch TV what you are looking, you can buy 1+ Q1 definitely. 1+ could have given tableb top TV stand, rather than ordering seperately. Go ahead...!!!👍",Picture Perfect....!!!!!!,B07W5QZQ45
"All the negative reviews are because of very bad installation service provided by amazon .. Otherwise tv is awesome in every aspects . Picture quality and sound quality are of top-notch ,os is very smooth and remote will take some time for getting used to but after that you will really appreciate it .",Tv is great but amazon installation service very bad,B07W5QZQ45
"Good TV with high design, great sound and decent cost, but Amazon had the worst installation process rather than adding the process along with TV delivery. After 5 days i had my TV installed, where i had to follow with amazon and OnePlus customer service as well... 5* for TV 4* for amazon delivery (stand and tv has been delivered at different timings 0* fot amazon customer service, where none of them are aware about the installation process",Worth for the money and quality.. unlike amazon service,B07W5QZQ45
I have bought q1 pro i didnt get any table top stand then whats the use of buying it just for a sound bar..,Didnt get any table top stand in package,B07W5QZQ45
"This is superb tv. Earlier I bought TCL but than cancelled THD order as got many negative reviews od that brand. Bought One Plus and iam really happy with its quality.. Picture quality is good not exactly as in samsung qled but it's picture quality is still good if you are watching satellite tv but if u watch online content than picture quality is superb and sound quality is really awesome n better than other tv. No requirement od sound bar. Sound quality is too good with powerful woffer effect of bass. It has all online continbuilt like Netflix, amazon play, eros now, zee5,youtube etc. Google play is also there so you can download any app which you want. Iam happy with my investment.",Superb Tv- Real value for money,B07W5QZQ45
"The TV is awesome. Picture quality is great. Sound is awesome Only issue is with TV remote pairing with TV, when I tried to use Google assistance on the remote it is asking for pairing, when I tried to pair the TV it's not pairing, the only message I see ""Press OK and Home button simultaneously and keep the remote close to TV Release buttons when pairing starts"" Please put the remote control near the TV. I charged the remote for 45 minutes and tried to pair it, still no luck. Is there any issue with TV or Remote control???? I want OnePlus or Amazon to resolve this issue.",Value for money,B07W5QZQ45
"Absolutely fantastic. We have used OnePlus Phones in our family earlier. Took a chance with the TV. Happy user for a week. Maybe too early, but very pleased with the fit and finish, the colour projections, the remote (yes!) and the overall neatness of the set. I have the Q1 model and don’t find it overpriced at all, contrary to any other opinion. The Q1 Pro may perhaps be overpriced, ₹30k for that sound bar may be an overkill.",Great Product,B07W5QZQ45
Nice tv,Nice tv,B07W5QZQ45
"1. TV is not compatible with External Soundbar or home theater. It gives sound output either in TV speakers or Soundbar not in both together through optical cable or bluetooth. 2. I didn't get the Alexa device free given during sale as well. These points are the main reason for 4 star otherwise Picture quality, Dolby atmos in both picture and sound is good in this budget TV. This product is good value for money spent. Most of the apps like Amazon prime, Hotstar, YouTube are already installed. Only Netflix is the app, which is not installed and you have to wait for it.",Main Points to note before buy.,B07W5QZQ45
"Hi folks, I got this TV installed on my bedroom wall, replacing a 42"" TV. It is sleek and looks good. The installation guys did a perfectly nice job. Removed all the bits of dust and clutter before leaving. Picture and sound quality is good. The TV setup process a simple, just like setting up a smart phone for the first time. Remote is sleek. The volume buttons are on the side and almost flushed with the thin body. Need sometime to get used to it. Also it gets lost frequently, being so thin and small. There is no mute button, so you will have to reduce the volume all the way to zero. The remote is quite responsive though. All is perfect, except few things which I did not like. Hence given 4 stars. 1. The TV boots up to a Home Screen where you have to select Live TV or other stuff like Amazon prime or YouTube etc. This happens every time you switch ON. I have a DTH set top box connected to the TV HDMI, but it does not start directly to the STB channels. This is annoying. Earlier TV was booting directly to the STB channels and when I wanted the smart TV features, I used the remote. The switching ON and watching the STB channels is a ritual that takes 8 to 10 seconds each time for the OnePlus TV. 2. When anyone tries to connect a bluetooth device, like headphone, the screen goes to the pairing options display. This happens even if a neighbor is trying to set up something in his home. You have to cancel his request, then navigate back to the channel you were watching. But if the other person re-sends the pairing request, the whole process has to be repeated again. Very annoying especially if you are watching something interesting, live match etc. There should be an option to bypass this. 3. The connection ports like USB, HDMI are located behind the TV in such a manner that it is nearly impossible to attach or detach any cable or USB drive with the TV mounted on the wall. You will have to remove it from the bracket, then settle the cable connections or USB drive and mount it back. The dismounting and mounting is easy but the TV is big so you need at least 2 adults and handle very carefully. I have procured the table mounting stand separately, but will use it sometime later. If these things do not bother you, then it is a good choice and can go for it.",Good choice,B07W5QZQ45
See the vertical black line coming after less than 3 week of usage... It's experience like old crt based television where magnetic impacts on screen... Are this coming from past technology.. Let's see what OnePlus say about it... Booked service call.. waiting for come and replace entire tv.. bur not sure this will again happened.. Will update you guys...,Vertical visible broad black line on screen,B07W5QZQ45
"1. Delivery and installation happened on the same day without any issues. 2. Sound quality is really amazing, I really liked it. I don't think we need to go for the pro version just for an additional soundbar. 3. Picture quality is not bad but you can't compare with Sony Bravia. 4. Remote is very comfortable to handle it but it will be good to add at least the mute button in the upcoming release. 5. Opening Apps takes more time even in 100Mbps speed, so software quality needs to be checked and updated. 6. Got cashback of 5k immediately using HDFC debit card, its a good deal.",Overall good product and good deal,B07W5QZQ45
"Here in India all brands having stand as well as wall hanging but One plus have only wall mounting. If we need stand which is very costly. It s very difficult to agree with you. Currently I am staying a rented apartment which is not very suitable for wall mounting. Moreover for changing of cable everytime we need to remove wall mounting for action. It is very difficult. Moreover just one month is nearing. So can not update my comlete opinion. Secondly since this is a new TV in the market, company should provide technical assistant. But here no such arrangements provide by Amazon. One more noticeable point is your remote not up-to the mark. Your handbook also not providing any technical details. Due to this we are expecting assistant from your side",One plus TV review,B07W5QZQ45
I have been using one plus 7 mobile and with mobile quality in mind I thought of buying the tv as well. But unfortunately the tv is nowhere near the hype created for the product. At the cost of buying to picture quality delivered is pathetic. At close to 1Lakh tv I could have bought Sony TV with sound bar! Suggest not to buy it's just waste of money.,Waste of money,B07W5QZQ45
1) Awesome sound quality. Mind blowing. I have never experienced such deep bass from any flat TVs ever 2) Picture quality is decent. Images are a little over saturated. 3) Interface is good and easy to navigate. 4) Remote is sleek. Not so user friendly I feel. 5) Amazon delivery was fast and installation done as promised without much hazzle.,Great package overall,B07W5QZQ45
"I got this product on 16th of October, I was excited about the product, but it didn’t last for couple of days. I noticed that, the audio is getting cut for 2 seconds for every 2:20 seconds. So I have raised a request for Technician to look into the issue. The technician didn’t turn up as per the schedule. After making several calls, the technician said he will come to my home. After sometime I received a sms saying the customer wants to reschedule. The service seems to be worst and waiting for a resolution.",Worst experience,B07W5QZQ45
"Went to the store to check out the TV. Am buying 4. Sales staff is very rude and not upto the mark. If this is the case, wondering what the after sales support is going to be. Will definitely not buy this product if the experience with their own brand store is so bad. Not worth it.",Really bad sales experience,B07W5QZQ45
TV is awesome,Superb,B07W5QZQ45
Worst purchase ever .. never buy such a tv from amazon. TV screen went bad in 20 days and am following for an engineer to visit for the last 20 days. The whole system is broken,"Worst purchase decision of my life, torture by Amazon",B07W5QZQ45
"Remote looks very good in pics but in reality it's like a 10cm scale thin one...Volume control is big challenge..everytime with Google opt only..but it's good that its rechargeable one. TV picture Quality and sound quality are awsome with HD videos..but don't expect to see the SD channels. (USB port is not as expected..everytime we have to plug in n out to detect, there is no option to find the USB - This issue fixed with s/w updates ), but Its taking long time to detect and there is no backward n forward optn. It would have been good if One+ having table top stand or wall mount with movable one. It has only fixed wall mount which is no space to use if there is any switchboard at backside wall. Very careful needed on screen and remote. If small kids at home don't expect it for long run..so Overall I can give 4star",Good one..Go for it,B07W5QZQ45

Excellent product in this price range and very good picture quality but even though sound put to zero level small humming sound coming from speakers. Features are very good and excellent remote design but there is no mute button on remote which is great drawback for this product. One more excellent feature I liked very much is by placing or covering the power light TV switches ON as well as OFF. In warranty card 12 months warranty mentioned but who ever purchased it before 25 Oct they get additional one more year warranty how can we claim this additional warranty? .Overall it's very good product from one Plus brand.,Excellent product,B07W5QZQ45
I just got it for 59K on Diwali sale and i would say after two weeks usage its premium and worth for money in all the way!! Thanks Amazon for delivered it without damage and OnePlus for this great made!,Premium Meets Elegance !,B07W5QZQ45

"I had choice to buy Sony, Samsung in same budget, but when I compared OnePlus features with Sony and Samsung they were far away.

Amazing TV at this price point and what else we can expect when we get great offers from AMAZON. True motion is something you need to toggle when you watch sports and movies.

"Fist of all the picture and sound quality of the TV of good, but The TV which I received got some issues, 1st TV's display got 15 to 20 nonworking pixels due to this TV shows black dots in every content, also in some frames, I can see whit sports on the black screen, I did call Amazon support team after a lot of calls that somehow agreed but still they did not confirm the replacement of my TV, they asked 72 hours to get confirmation from upper management, so I am wating for their response, hope they will replace it, otherwise I need to go to consumer forum, Also, I need to say that Amazon's delivery team and installation guy didn't handle TV properly, as TV should be unboxed from bottom side but they remove the TV from upper side of the box also single guy removed it which can damage the tv easily, I think that is why the white spots are coming on the display, also installation guy did not given the demo of the TV and he told me that someone from their team will come and provide the demo but they just close the installation process without any demo. I will update the review if my tv got replaced by amazon.",Some pixel not working,B07W5QZQ45

If you are looking to get a TV installed and get a great viewing experience as well as customise the viewing experience then this is the TV.

In top brands that's not the case.,Not for the faint hearted,B07W5QZQ45
"Picture and sound is great but if you go deeper you could clearly see theres no good picture upscaling which makes 720p look terrible here. You can watch 1080p, its great in bright scenes but some dark scenes just look bad! The are choppy and look like 240p content. 4k is great theres no complain here. They might give updates to improve it but lets see. Similarly the sound is great but theres a catch. The bass is not always great. Sometimes or just on bass frequency maybe won't play like others. Its almost like beating the speakers with something. But its only with high bass content otherwise its great. The software isnt that optimized so you might see some glitches here wnd there. And i faced some connectivity issues maybe its just me. Overall its a nice tv but could have been better at this price!",Great but not best for its price.,B07W5QZQ45

Within half an hour they have completed installation. Only drawback was that there is no stand for the TV. It is only wall mount. Coming to quality, it is awesome, outstanding. You can add many more adjectives. There is no Netflix installed with TV. All other apps are pre-installed. The remote is really cute and easy to operate and it is chargeable. You have Google Assistant and Prime TV in the Remote. Just like computer, you can make the TV in sleep mode, restart and shut down. You have pre-installed screen savers.

"Overpriced, but OK. 4k content picture clarity is good, sound quality is good, no sound bars required, bazel less design good Cons, need to be improved 1)Missing mute button in remote, don't know why one plus missed this, mute works only with alexa, very limited buttons in remote 2)OS slow, multiple clicks required to turn off tv 3)No Browser, no Netflix 4)Complex operating for old people. With same budget you can go for other brands",Overprice,B07W5QZQ45
TV was delivered within a day and installation done immediately. Very prompt and well prepared service team. Very happy with the service provided.

"Very good TV. Excellent picture quality and sound clarity. However, I had expected better bass performance as it includes 2 sub-woofers. Netflix is still not added.

Using this TV since a month. Picture quality from HD feed or YouTube/Amazon prime is excellent. SD channels viewing experience is acceptable.

So not using the speakers when viewing dish channels,Pretty good TV but slightly overpriced,B07W5QZQ45

"The OnePlus TV is a 55"" 4K QLED TV that comes with Android TV OS. It has 3GB Ram and 16Gb Internal Storage. I have the Q1 Pro variant with me. The display and Sound quality are amazing. The sliding out speakers with the glowing LED is an absolute delight and something new. I have been using the TV from the launch time and here are my observations. -------------- ⏩⏩ Pros: -------------- 👍 4K QLED display is amazing. The color pop out and the Blacks are deep giving a great viewing experience. The screen is bright and the option to control back light is useful. 👍 Dolby Vision, HDR10 and HDR10+ support for watching selected content in High dynamic range. This helps a lot in improving the viewing experience. 👍 Dolby Atmos support for improved audio quality. 👍 Minimal bezels for immersive viewing experience. 👍 Has many Input ports for multi-utility. 4 HDMI 2.0 ports, 1 Ethernet, 1 USB 3.0, 1 USB 2.0, 1 Optical, 1 AV and 1 RF. One of the HDMI supports ARC. 👍 The 50W speaker is loud and clear. Front firing gives a better audio experience. 30-40% volume is sufficient for a large room. The LED lighting and sliding out feature is surely an attraction. With bluetooth stereo, the LED on the speaker even blinks with the music like a visualizer. 👍 Android TV OS. This provides access to tons of Apps and games. The software updates are promised by OnePlus for 3 years. Already got an update that improved the HDR performance. 👍 Connect App for controlling TV from the Phone. Useful for multitasking. 👍 Chromecast Built-in. So you can easily cast videos, photos and other media with a click. No need to connect every time. 👍 Screen mirroring is supported and works smoothly. 👍 The remote can be recharged by a regular charger. No need for AA/AAA batteries. 👍 Bluetooth connectivity. 50 W speakers can be used as Bluetooth Speakers with the Stereo Option or you can connect a Bluetooth headphone to listen in isolation. 👍 TV can be controlled by Google Assistant and Alexa enables devices. -------------- ⏩⏩ Cons: -------------- 👎 The Software needs some improvement and hopefully it will be improved in time. 👎 The native video player needs improvement as it struggles to play some video file formats. 👎 HDR optimization needs improvement in regards to colors. 👎 The remote though looks super sleek and trendy, it's not a practical approach. No Mute button and changing 👎 TV channels is a hassle by navigation keypads. So not Elderly friendly. 👎 The Table top stand is not stable. It wobbles even with a small touch. 👎 The extra price for the Q1 Pro variant. 👎 No 3.5mm Port. 👎 Control options with Google Assistant and Alexa to be increased. --------------------- ⏩⏩ Conclusion: --------------------- If you are looking for a TV with QLED 4K Display and Android TV OS, then OnePlus TV is a good option to choose, provided you go for the Q1 variant. As this is the first product in TV segment for the brand, the service might need some time to establish well.",Great Option for People who want a QLED 4K TV| Read before you buy 📺🤩,B07W5QZQ45

Not working properly bad picture quality we can buy it for 3k is high,Overall,B07W5QZQ45
"The guy who came for installing TV seems to be a novice. He is not aware of optic cable The issue is that the inbuilt apps is not transmitting sound thru my Onkyo home theatre sys Kindly send an experienced technician to sort the issue. And also replacement policy by Amazon is skewed in the sense that its deliberately made very very cumbersome. First you have to call Amazon customer support staff, the wait time for which is invariably 15-20 mins. Then you need to tell him or her the reasons for seeking replacement which they will not agree to most of the times. SO I will be very very skeptical in buying anything from Amazon going forward",Inbuilt Apps including USB drive not transmitting sound through Amplifier,B07W5QZQ45
Product quality can be defined only when it gets installed. No care for installation of the product very poor services. Already logged complaint also rescheduled the appointment but still no response from installation team,Poor services,B07W5QZQ45
Lot of flaws in the TV.. Like no Netflix no browser mobile screen share problem... 70 k for what?Only display? Samsung q led 55 inch with all features offering 80 k that too is a brand.. Can't find any outstanding features to shift to oneplus,Not worthy,B07W5QZQ45
"I bought this TV from somewhere and asking myself these questions. Ask yourself. 99k for what? - Just 16GB storage. Should have been 128GB atleast. How many apps can you download in 16GB. - Just 50 watts sound? - Just two years warranty? Why not four? because the processor slows down over time. 99k for just two years. - Just 3 GB RAM. Should have been 8GB atleast. Don't understand how well the TV will be able to process apps, resolution and sound with just 3GB RAM. It's performance is not that great. - Only 2 sub-woofer. Not even proper surround sound. All this for just 99K",Ask yourself....,B07W5QZQ45
"I bought oneplus TV from reliance digital. Delivery and installation was awesome from reliance digital. Its good tv and most of them are talking about positive things. Just want to share the bug which is there in TV software. 1. Restart issue - Restart option just shutdown the TV and it never switch on TV back. 2. youtube cast - youtube casting from mobile to TV does not work sometime. When you cast from mobile it just try to connect tv and it never cast. you have to restart TV to work. 3.Pinkish color effect there in some video in vivid picture option. workaround is to use standard mode. 4. Forward option does not work properly in default video player. Some time it hang and you have to go back to file browser and play again to work. It never remembers current video time, when you forward video in second time, it starts forward from where first forward was ended ( never starts froward from current video time) 5. Grains noise is coming when playing video in high volume and some of the video. Same video playing in other TV. 6. You will notice lag in prime videos when play initially ( Note: I have 150mbps internet speed). Immediately the TV try to play in high resolution and it get stuck. Oneplus TV need more software optimization and testing. If anyone is planning to buy, i suggest them to wait for sometime till they fix all software bugs.",Review after 2 weeks of usage.,B07W5QZQ45
"I got this in Rs.72499 + 5000 OFF at https://amzn.to/33y8C6E & extra warranty. Both PRO & basic OnePlus TVs features 4K QLED panel with a 95.7 percent screen-to-body ratio, however, only the Q1 Pro gets an integrated sliding soundbar. Lets see my quick review for this after 1 week of use. PROS: 1. It's Ok, OnePlus is Brand in the mobile segment but the TV segment is different. 2. 4k quality is good, One plus tv, the tv with oversaturated colors without “Netflix Certified.” 3. The colors don't look real and accurate on 1+plus TV, colors are highly saturated and there is a strong green and yellow tint in colors the white balance is also not accurate blues look sky-blue n sky blues looks teal greenish. 4. With a higher motion rate, you can fully enjoy fast GAMING performance. 5. The chargeable TV remote. 6. Dolby Vision 7. QLED panel will improve the viewing angle to 178 degrees. CONS: 1. It's overpriced. 2. Its motion rate, not refresh rate, its actual refresh rate is 200Hz 3. Oneplus misses the headphone jack. 4. Ports are really closer to each other... Sometimes we cannot connect two HDMI together at the same time. 5. They take 1 week for installation. 6. No Tabletop stand provided.",Got this in Rs.72499 + 5000 OFF at https://amzn.to/33y8C6E,B07W5QZQ45
This tv does not support Netflix despite you download Netflix app,Useless if you buy as expensive smart tv,B07W5QZQ45
"It is a very good TV, undoubtedly! It delivers awesome sound without even a bit of distortion. The picture quality is superb! For this rate, one can't expect anything more. Very good deal also. It has made other TV manufacturers to reduce prices so that they can survive. Expectations: 1.Netflix needs to be included. 2.Remote could have been designed still better, honestly. 3. Table stand should have been given by default. 4. Bit difficult to plug/insert cables once it's wall mounted. That irks. Changes can be considered in design in this regard in future. Overall, I am delighted after viewing its fabulous performance although I had my own doubts initially whether I had made a correct decision. Go and Grab the TV before stock gets over!",Superb 4K QLED TV by OnePlus,B07W5QZQ45

"Out of mind to keep sucha price. The ""quality comes at price"" but can't be difference of 3 times. Joke really !!",What a crazy price !!,B07W5QZQ45
"This is like iPhone nowadays.. too highly priced. You can buy a decent 55 4k TV at the price of 30k with 3 year warranty, where One plus TV with just 2 year warranty cost you 70k. If the seller itself giving us only 2 year warranty, when other brands like Mitashi & VU is giving 3 years, customers can just think the quality of TV is not great. Moral: craziness towards Style & brand name is lost Amazon, people are sensible enough to buy products matching value for money.",Too highly priced... not at all value for money!,B07W5QZQ45
It's been 10 days since I got the TV and still the installation has not happened. The brand is unable to provide a corner wall mount to the TV. And there is no alternative available.,Corner wall mount not available for the TV,B07W5QZQ45
"Viewing this TV for the past 15 days. Picture and sound quality is amazing. Demo from Amazon guy is poor. The person does not know or in a great hurry. Separately paying 3k for table top stand is not worth. If you touch TV it shakes, scarey. Suggest customers to go for Wall mounting. Remote built in battery is great, charging by guess. No indication. Big minus point. Overall it is a good purchase.","Great performance, value for money, Go for it",B07W5QZQ45

Stand - 3k extra. this is a disappointment. 70k tv does not even provide stand. but ok . stand is also ok ok not satisfactory as it wobbles whole tv when u plug in something to any ports. a star less for the stand. performance - u need to have speed above 20 mbps in order to play 4k content. conclusion - overall good enough. sad thing, installation - no facility provided from amazon or onelplus, had to get its arrangement on my own. 5 star for the product, but one star less for lack of installation facility, and a star less for the stand quality and sturdiness.",superb qled tv. buy this model don't go for pro model. 70k it's good enough. superb sound.,B07W5QZQ45

"Oneplus has killed this!! Such a great masterpiece. The picture quality is outstanding. Well purchasing in amazon will be a bad idea coz you can see many complaints about the installation delay and everything. But this beast is also available in Reliance Digital Store(Offline) where you can see the product and get to know about it. Better to purchase in Reliance. I purchased Q1 pro there and their service is great. By the way,if you planning to buy this ,blindly go for it!",A BEAUTY INSIDE A BEAST,B07W5QZQ45
"Only after buying the Oneplus TV, I realised difference between QLED and LED. The picture looks far better than LED Tv. Please don’t compare price with LED TV. QLED is a different technology. The extra few thousands that you pay is for better quality picture and sound. Sound is great and clear. I found navigation to be ok, as to reach input option of TV I need to press button twice. An input key on remote would have been great to shuffle between cable and apps. That I would have appreciated installed Netflix, which is missing, but I resolved the problem with Amazon Firestick which was given to me free by TataSky. Oneplus says they are soon coming up with Netflix app in the TV. There is no Oneplus app for iphone, which again I was expecting from Oneplus.

"Hardware : TV looks quite premium and sturdy with minimal bezels. Picture Quality : Both HDR non HDR contents looks great. XBOX 4K HDR games look amazing. Colors are punchy. Software : Needs lot of updates and bug fixes, youtube is stuttering continuously, bluetooth audio has static noise and audio delay. Most of the streaming apps stutter while playing 4K HDR content. Hope all the bugs are fixed soon via software updates. Alexa integration and commands works great. Remote Control: I did not like the stock aluminum remote, looks great but not very practical. Most used buttons are missing ""Inputs, Mute, Picture Mode, Power off"" (Long press 1+ button is slow) rather use Alexa to turn off. I did get free updates remote from oneplus with website, Its far better than the original remote. Comes with Netflix, Youtube, Input buttons) Hope oneplus ships this with new orders. I am very happy with my purchase, just hoping for bug fixes.","Great hardware, far from perfect software.",B07W5QZQ45

70000 for Chinese brand seems like a wastage of money. Over saturated pictures is the worst thing about this TV. Secondly android operating system is inferior compared to LG's Webos. If you want to spend 70000 choose wisely. Go for LG television they're way ahead of all the peers. One will buy this TV who's happy to waste hard earn money on this cheap product.,Waste of money one plus brand.,B07W5QZQ45
I was quite impressed with the TV in terms of Quality . It is well built and looks smart. SD content don't look nice however the TV does justice to HD contents. 4K comes our beautifully. The colors at times do feel over saturated specially the Red. Very poor Installation service. I was delivered the TV in Oct and no one turned up to Install the same. I finally ended up doing it myself. I hope the response is not the same in case of any defects which only time will tell.,Poor post delivery istallation service,B07W5QZQ45

"The picture quality was average and now there is a big black vertical bar coming on the TV. We have already complained to them and so far we are only following with them to make a visit and replace this faulty tv which is 2 month’s old. The SAGA continues, We called the warranty claim service , no one came physically despite the assigned date and time. One person calls and says it will take 35 K to repair it without even seeing it. When we informed that TV is only 2 months old , the person said the Amazon guaranty is only for 10 days and it is over, One plus will not entertain these complaints. WHAAAT ???

"It's been about a month of daily usage and the only thing that disappointed me was the sound. Though it is a 50W speaker, the sounds come out feeling a little muffled. Though point has to be noted that it could also be because of the way our living room is shaped, so results may vary. Picture quality is really good for the price but yes, the HDR is not as good as in OLEDs, so if you can afford it, you should go for an OLED TV. 4k content on it looks pretty good, but while playing 1080p content, you can see that the upscaling is not particularly great. The UI is pretty smooth and clean, both while using the remote or the android app. The TV looks at home in the most beautiful at decors and just seems like a good purchase as far as I feel.",Good enough at the price.,B07W5QZQ45

"This TV IS A QLED AND NOT AN OLED. The MAIN DIFFERENCE between a QLED and OLED is that QLED is a LCD panel who backlight is lit by HUGE LEDs. OLED display is have their own millions LEDs to emit light in the display. Hence, The picture quality of OLED is very much better than QLED. QLED TVs are thicker than OLEDs. I'm NOT saying that QLEDs are bad, I'm just trying to explain the technology difference. If you need the TV for purely entertainment purpose, I suggest you to buy a Samsung AMOLED or LG OLED TV. But also remember the price of OLED TV is double the price of QLED TV. Please hit the like if you found this review helpful. Thanks.",DON'T BUY WITHOUT READING THIS!!!!!!!! QLED VS OLED,B07W5QZQ45

Despite raising the ticket with one plus and sending them all the proofs there has not been much progress . Just FYI , i am writing this review after waiting for 12 days to hear from One Plus . Worst part is that One Plus doesn't even get back to me unless i call up the Customer Care every 2 days . Though it has a warranty and the TV picture quality is good I would advice people to wait for 2 to 3 versions until the TV issues get stabilized or go for a different brand .",Grey Bar at the Center of the screen after one month of Usage,B07W5QZQ45

"For reference, in my living room I'm using a LG 55"" 1080p oled screen with nvidia shield tv and JBL LSR 308 MK2 studio monitors for sound. Using Sanyo in the bedroom with a yamaha YAS 108 soundbar connected with an optical cable. tl;dr: You get what you pay for. It's a good IPS panel which needs some tuning. The android tv experience is awful, you may get an aftermarket device like nvidia shield tv. Discerning videophiles stay away, this is a good inexpensive second tv if you need one but definitely not the one for your living room. Pros: - Above average IPS panel. Has some vignetting around corners and contrast isn't all that great because this' an IPS panel, but viewing angle is nice and wide. For the cost, a great panel is all I wanted. - The noise reduction and motion handling seem alright so far, except for 4k@60Hz. - Good external design - Acceptable sound. - Android TV Cons: - The software (Android TV implementation) is a huge mess. I've been using nvidia shield tv for 4 years now and the lack of attention to details on this 'smart' TV shows. - To begin with, the specs to run the Android TV aren't great, so the interface lags badly. Also because of the lower amount of RAM, every time you launch an app e.g. Netflix, it starts with the login process every effing time. - The google assistant is a hit and miss, because of the slower system. - The specs on this TV can't handle a youtube video 4k@60fps. The debug mode shows a lot of dropped frames which leads to jerky videos. 4k@24fps seems alright. - Only 5 color profile modes i.e. Standard, Vivid, Sport, Game and User. No Movie mode calibration. The user mode can be tuned to your liking with some basic options, no advanced color calibration options available. - THIS IS WHAT I HATE THE MOST: The option to tune picture and other TV options isn't available in the main menu or by pressing menu on the remote when you're in android tv screen. You have to press source and select some source option, now the menu will bring up 'more settings' where you may tune the picture settings. Sanyo, you have such a huge remote where most of the buttons are absolutely useless, would it have killed you put in a dedicated button to bring up the advanced menu? - Some picture settings apply only to the video, e.g. the color temperature. The android TV menu and even the subtitles aren't affect by these settings. E.g. If you select warm gamma, the subtitles and the android main screen still appear with a blue hue. - Amazon prime isn't available as an android tv app (although it's available on shield tv). Casting amazon prime onto this panel isn't a very pleasant experience. It doesn't play most of the times.","Great as bedroom TV, not for the living room",B07X413J1G

Bought this TV to replace another 4K tv. REally happy about the purchase Pros Alround good picture and voice quality. Very crisp HD tv channels render. Sports channels are fluid. Android installation was breeze. Android 9 recognizes mobile phone (or vice versa) and all you have to say is - Okay google set up my TV. Wifi installation was quick and and the first thing to happen was TV app updated to latest one. This TV is slim and appears smaller compared to another brand I had earlier.

"So all in all good product, the sound seems a little bit off. picture quality is as best as it is available in the market Don't be fooled if this is your first android tv , yes it does ships with google play store but don't be under the impression of getting tons of application to play around with. You will be left with limited apps, out of that also very less would be actually useful tip:- still haven't used or tested Netflix (but the separate button is given for the same) if you are buying this for family recommended is amazon prime rather than Netflix which will be only English while prime is much cheaper giving most of the local language movies and shows pros:- 1)screen (4K HDR) 2)lightweight 3)wireless life 4)low on budget 5)inbuilt chrome cast(which means you will be able to cast everything from your android mobile device as long as you are connected on the same wifi network-->tried amazon prime works like butter) cons:- 1)sound quality 2)amazon prime missing update after using it for 15-20 days pros:- 1)can watch downloaded movies by plugging Pendrive(saw 10 GB print of avatar -->real treat for the eyes) 2)limited apps to play around with when using it over the internet like hotstar , prime,zee5,jio movies,NetFlix(there is no jio tv ) 3)can play small games like hungry shark or some car games (but big no no for graphics games like pubg) cons:- 1)sound quality goes off the cart when watching some standup comedy on youtube defn it needs some major upgrades 2)side loading of apps is next to impossible (even in spite of it being an android tv){meaing you cant download an app into Pendrive and install it)",Prime is missing(don't know about the dates for OTA update),B07X413J1G

"Bought this one with high expectations, unfortunately it didn't work. First of all the HDR badge of this tv is a gimmick I guess. It doesn't play HDR for YouTube only 4K. Voice search in YouTube doesn't work. Amazon prime is unavailable so HDR playability of that is also questionable. videos from usb doesn't play in HDR. Sound out put through HDMI provides only stereo output no 5.1 channel. And the worst thing with my unit is screen bleeding. It's horrible. Raised a request for replacement but haven't got any confirmation. Even the energy star sticker was also missing. Now I feel like going for Mi or Motorola tv would had been a good choice. The only plus is normal 4k content looks good specially with thin bezels it gives a cinematic experience. So think twice before going for this.",Don't keep your expectations high,B07X413J1G

Thanks Ashish ----------- I bought this TV during the sale and the transaction, delivery and installation was VERY smooth. One reason I bought this TV was for Prime Video. The TV comes with a built in app but that app fails to stay logged in. Every time one has to sign in and verify account using keyboard on TV remote. This happens every single day. After spending a few hours with Amazon tech support I am told that this TV and a bunch of others like Mi and Vu are 'presently' not compatible. The issue has been escalated and the app will be fixed. But there is no fixed timeline. So till then login Everytime.",Works very well Great Customer Service,B07X413J1G
"I chose this over MI TV and Motorola Tv. There are few glaring issues: 1. The screen works fine when movie is playing (see pics, one black n white movie and one colour movie) , but when we operate menu or in some display screen, the screen is very uneven. I have attached 4 pics, you can see the uneveness. I am not sure if this is defective, or this is how it is supposed to work. But, while playing movies, it has no issues. May be backlight issue? 2. Installation I had no issues. But wall mount is pretty basic, but it is going to be very difficult to remove once placed. Very bad quality wall mount 3. Sound is loud. I like it, I hardly go above 25% and it is enough for my room. Better than MI TV 4. I don't use the inbuilt Netflix and prime. I have prime stick, and I use it. No issues so far For given the price, it's good. But if given a choice again, I would have chose MI TV, which was around 1k cheaper. Also this unevenness during display irritating me. I don't know if it is a defect or not. Pls coment below with your views",Not sure if to return or keep it,B07X413J1G
"I m very happy with this product. Screen quality is awesome. Audio is very good. Viewing angles are great. I connected it with my Portable HDD. It is working flawlessly without any lag. It has one usb 3.0 jack and another one normal. I tried connecting Bluetooth headphone with it and it works nice too. Android experience is great. I connected it with dth thru HDMI port(total-3) and it's working superb and also connected it to my PC and tried playing games and again superb results when you see the gameplay in 4k but my rig was like ""I was bought for a 1080p monitor"" need to upgrade graphics card. Very happy with my purchase and believe me this is a great TV and you can trust this Japanese brand without any second thought. Amazon delivered it very next day. They only raised a call with the company to install it and within 48 hrs Panasonic dealer came with his mechanic and they mounted it. No problem at all.

"The TV is advertised as being able to play Amazon prime video. In fact the picture of the product has a prime video app shown prominently. Surprisingly I tried to login to prime video first thing today when I got the TV and was unable to login after repeated attempts. Talking to prime video support I was informed that sanyo is not authorized to stream prime video content and so I cannot watch prime video content on this TV, although I have a prime subscription. Update: i got a call from sanyo rep who walked me through registering for prime video, and after doing a reset prime seems to be working for me now (registration needs to be done on a desktop browser rather than mobile).",Prime works after help from support,B07X413J1G
Pros: TV Looks good Picture quality is awesome 3 HDMI Ports is a plus YouTube Streaming is very smooth and seamless. Sound quality is decent enough. Cons: So far None.

"TV got delivered and installed in time. The person could not complete demonstration due to power failure. Thereafter again and again I am trying for their support but there is no response. The person came for installation is disconnecting my calls....... Before purchasing and installing I was been told over phone that this TV model supports prime video. Also one of the customer's review says so, for which the customer has uploaded the screenshot with prime video icon. For two three days I tried my best to install this app, but couldn't do.

Almost a week since we got this TV..Got it at a very good price with exchange...

If you are planning to get your first smart TV ..go gor it..,Excellent product at the price range,B07X413J1G
"I have been using the 32 inch model TV for about 3 days now. Very happy so far.... This tv is available for 11.5k plus an additional 10pct discount on credit cards. Great bang for the buck! Pros #Android tv...so there's a whole world of apps, you tube movies, games etc that you can install. Also to play movies from your home library (by connecting hard drive or pen drive into USB port), you can install VLC media player app which is better than the default movie player app that comes pre-installed. VLC plays almost any movie format and will also display subtitles properly. #Great LED panel with good viewing angles, decent contrast and brightness. The IPS panel is almost 80% as good as a Samsung....don't expect the same quality as this is a budget tv. #Digital audio out (optical) in addition to the HDMI return port so that you can connect your home theatre system. #remote and menu is very easy to operate, being android OS #very thin bezels... Looks sleek Cons #Only 1 year warranty on the panel #Speaker sound is very tinny... It's ok for general purposes, bit if you want to enjoy a movie it will be good to buy a standalone music system which will do a better job than a TV speaker regardless of which brand you buy. TV speakers have a tiny form factor so that constraints the performance. #slight delay while switching between apps... Which is not a big deal really... This is not a phone after all # there is cheap plastic cladding around the bezels... High end TVs have metal which looks more classy # even though the Amazon prime app is installed, you cannot use it to play videos... Amazon for some reason doesn't register the tv as a device. I think Amazon wants people to pay an extra 3k for their fire stick. But there is an easy work around... Since the tv comes with built-in Chromecast, you can cast any thing on the phone to the TV (provided you have an Android phone and there's a home WiFi connection that both your tv and phone can connect to). So open up prime video on the phone and simply cast it to your tv.... Works like a charm.",Perfect for the price!,B07X413J1G
"Sorry Sanyo for writing this review after so many days, as i didn't have the word's to express my feelings and views about this Tv. Before buying this Tv i just checked , it's a #japanese Tv, #latest Stock Android and cheaper in its segment compared to its Chinese counter parts. My first impressions is #WTF, i don't know may be i was shifting from CRT Tv ,where you don't find graining as it is common in LCD and lED panels. the best viewing distance for this 32 inch tv is beyond 8 feet or you will see the graining in pictures. Pros :- pricing - cheaper in its segment Features - stock android, cromecast support, ips led, wide range of app support. Os- Latest android OS and Google play store support with all the present day necessary entertainment app support (youtube, Netflix, prime video, sonyliv, voot, zee5 etc). with stock Android you will get limitless possibilities. Remote - A combination of old and modern type, so its easy to understand for every age group like your parents and grand parents. build quality is also good. Free wall mount - free wall mounting kit is available in the box not like chinese counter parts(Mi, tcl, iffalcon etc) where you have to pay extra 400- 500 more for it. Picture Quality- not great but 4.5 out of 5 as its a budget Tv and its competitors have little bit of poor quality than it, which i can bet. it can be enjoyed in HD channels and HD contents, else it is crap in SD connection so, don't blame Sanyo for your connection type. i got a new Airtel HD connection but somtimes that setup box transmit so bad colors that its looks completely crap apart drom that all online content like youtube, netflix etc have good color Quality. Brand Value - if you can think to buy cheap chinese crap like (Mi, Tcl, iffalcon etc) which have a experience of only 5- 6 years and doesn't manufacture panels just assemble the tv buying panel from Lg, Sony, Samsung and panasonic then you shouldn't hesitate to buy Sanyo as it is a #72 years old Japanese brand not only that its is backed by two companies as Sanyo got incorporated to Panasonic(101 year old) in 2009 and these companies are panel manufacturers and not only Tv assemblers like Chinese brands. so you are buying a Tv from a brand which has 173 years of experince in Tv manufacturing in total. Audio - Audio quality is good but Bluetooth audio is not that loud, if you connect your bluetooth speakers then make sure your Bluetooth speakers output is more that TV speakers i.e 20 watts. Service - i din't use their service as it's a 20 day old TV but from their installation service i can say that the after sales service is great, as i didn't called them for installation which is free, they called me from their end within 24 hrs of delivery and technician visited my house with in 12 hrs of that call, mounted my Tv , described its functionality, has a very polite behavior and Didn't even ask for #Tips like others do Airtel guy asked for extra #Tip after Installation. Not only that Panasonic guys called me @ times more to install the same Tv. from this i can say their after sells service will be great. Cons - Only two 1 - Picture quality is little bit of whitish and i believe all its chinese counterparts have worse than it not #Mototrola. but Motorola is costlier than Sanyo by 2000 usually and 4000 during Amazon great Indian sale. 2 - bezel less display - actually its not bezel less completely as the panel have 1/2 inch of border all around it you can see it in the picture where Sanyo could have added a frame covering the panel rather than leaving it just like that and saying it bezel less display as it is dangerous to small accident or little water splash as it can go easily inside the panel damaging the whole panel. if Sanyo you are reading it then please add a outer casing to protect the panel edges rather than leaving it just like that and saying it bezel less. And at-last its a great value for money even though Oneplus tv which costs some much didn't have #Netflix support in its Tv but this budget Tv has all in it. so, don't be fool buying chinese crap (Mi, tcl, iffalcon etc) just go for this Solid Japanese Built Sanyo Kaizen series andriod smart tv without any hesitation. with larger screen size you will get more features. i know nobody is going to read that much big review as i also didn't buy this Tv reading reviews but i youtubed it and luckily found one video about this TV which is great enough to convince me to buy this TV as the youtube is completely biased with chinese cheap crap TV's review. So, i am going to make a youtube review video very soon and i will update its link in this review.",The Best Budget Android Tv of 2019,B07X413J1G
"Superb smart tv, with good picture and sound quality for the price. Earlier I had some issues with registration on prime video, but I contacted the Amazon customer care they told me to factory reset the TV and then try to register, and now it is working fine. Sound requires some personal setting to tune it perfectly and picture quality is best in standard settings. All in all it is a good deal.",Excellent deal,B07X413J1G

"I have bought the 43 inch 4k variant 1. The picture quality is quite impressive and deliveres 4k HDR as promised at 60 fps. 2. This is only TV in this price range with IPS display with high viewing angle. This pretty much sealed the deal for me. 3. The sound is loud and clear.Its pretty loud even at low volumes. I wouldn't say it the best sound but you always buy an soundbar to go with your TV. 4. Since it runs android pie its clean and has google play store to install many apps and games. Just a pair a bluetooth joystick an you can play games on big screen. The OS is little buggy though, it didn't recognise my wifi at first and had some initial trouble in connecting my phone. 5. Most of the apps like Netflix, Youtube and Hotstar are available except for Amazon Prime but thanks to built-in chromecast you can stream it from your mobile swiftly. Eagerly waiting for the OTA to provide the Prime video app. 6. The google assistant works ok. Although the microphone could have been better.",Best Smart TV in this price range,B07X413J1G
"Product purchased: Sanyo 43"" Kaizen 4K UHD TV Mode: XT-43A082U Review feedback: I'm one who do not use Set-top box, Cable TV or Satellite dish. I use internet to watch online videos, movies. My review is based on that. Good points: Picture quality, IPS display is good. Tried with 4K resolution video. Looking Beautiful. Youtube, Hotstar works flawlessly. Netflix shutsdown automatically multiple times. Built-in chrome cast works for casting from mobile and cast from Google chrome browser from Windows PC. Voice recognition is also good. Major disappointments are - Pathetic audio quality. Audio is loud but not a quality sound. Sanyo claims Box speaker. I feel it is not designed for good acoustic. Sound response is very flat. - in internet/online mode, not possible to make any TV settings (like setting brightness, contrast, colour, Bass, Treble, etc..) - TV settings are available only for AV mode and HDMI mode. Since i don't have cable TV or Set-top box don't have option to change other than what is factory set. (refer picture attached. Only factory preset video and audio modes are possible to make) - Since TV settings are not possible in online mode - factory set backlight is eye irritating, especially watching during night without lights. Most surprising was : when called Sanyo service helpdesk they provided local service support contact number. And the person who visited home says, that is the TV limitations. And he commented that I should have bought after verifying in showroom. Unfortunately Sanyo is sold only online. :-( Overall, this is not a fault. It is a design overlook by Sanyo. Sanyo would have assumed customers will always use TV connection and less internet users. It may be a simple firmware upgrade Sanyo must do to address this issue.",Sanyo need more attention to details in design,B07X413J1G
"Got delivery on time. The Sanyo 'engineer', with a co-worker, showed up for installation the next day. He struggled to boot the tv on,...and the tv just did not relent! He gave up saying, 'Android tv pehle kabhi install nahin kiya hai. Kal, kisi Android TV wale saathi ko bhejunga!"" (and he left). 'Am keeping my fingers crossed in the hope that 'next day', i.e. tomorrow (Oct 15, 2019), a more competent 'engineer' shows up (although, with my vast experience of working with Android devices; I am 'sure' that the tv is meant to boot up on its own, once the power is switched on, without any help from any engineer. My gut feeling: the tv is defective). The Sanyo (Panasonic) engineer came the next day again, with another engineer colleague. They struggled again, but the tv didn't start working. Eventually, they phoned their 'Trainer', who, after listening to the issues, advised them to install some software first, which he was to send. The next day, the engineer came with the software, installed it, and the tv got 'installed' and started working. I was relieved, but all this was not a happy experience. Performance? Haven't spent much time with the tv yet. The SD channels aren't much good to watch. I guess there is no 'upscaling' mechanism in this tv. The sound is also not to my satisfaction (a bit squeaky), but online purchases carry all these 'risks', plus, I have paid only Rs 25000 for this tv. One thing: the Panasonic/Sanyo team was always instantly responsive!",Preliminary reaction: Don't have high expectations!,B07X413J1G

The picture quality is good but the smart features are very bad. I can't cast my mobile screen through chromecast. It could cast only one or two time then it stopped screen mirroring. I tried with two phones but I couldn't mirror the screen. I can't log in into Amazon Prime Video either. It gives a code and asks you to register your device on Amazon but even after registration through code I can't log in. Better buy a non-smart TV because this TV has very useless smart features.

"Dissatisfied with the customer service and the TV's internal hardware strength. Pros: - Good picture quality, but it dulls colours in darker shots. - Good and loud sound. - All ports work (3 ports in total) - Good build quality considering the price. Cons: - Installation person didn't understand Android OS that much. If something doesn't works, he would reset the whole TV and start again! - After sale support staff doesn't accept TV's flaws. Instead blames on the router. Also, when proved that it was TV's fault, they tried to misexplain us with wrong technical explanation. We had the technical know-how so could catch their deceit. - Remote has too many buttons for our use, and most of them will stay useless for our normal Android TV or set-top-box TV use. - Port placement is awkward if TV is wall-mounted. - Frame around the screen is of poor quality. Easily damageable. - Voice recognition on the remote is very poor. Have to speak very loudly and even then it doesn't translate properly. There's no visible mic hole on the remote. - 1.5GB RAM is not enough. The TV is slow. Takes almost a minute to start-up. Response time is very slow. - TV's WiFi range is very less. Can only work with same room routers or at high-speed bandwidth. Ours didn't work at 20 Mbps from different room. Had to change router position in same room as TV. - TV doesn't keep apps open after screensaver. RAM not enough. - App loading and internet content loading speed is less. Due to less RAM.","Disappointed with the service, there are better options at this price.",B07X413J1G

"If you are looking for a 4k uhd tv at a budget price, this TV is a good choice. It comes with android pie ootb, has netflix preinstalled, sound quality is good, picture quality is also appreciable with a good screen to body ratio. However, there is an however ofcourse.. You have to compromise on the system performance. There is only around 2 gb available for you to install additional apps and with the amount of ram its got, browsing through some apps (e. g. sony liv) is choppy. You dont get amazon prime and its not available on the play store either. You cannot adjust thr TV settings from the home screen for some reason, you can only do it from the screensaver screen which is very odd. But after all is said and done, you must realize that its a smart tv at a budget price and weigh in on its positive aspects.",A decent product.,B07X413J1G
"This is a complete smart TV powered by Android P. Besides a world class, smooth, intuitive Android-based smart TV experience this Sanyo 32"" LED TV has a picture perfect display & amazing sound quality, ideal for the bedroom. The remote is also high class, feels solid and premium in hand and has built-in mic to hear your voice commands for the Google Assistant which is integrated into the ecosystem. Voice input is universal. Works perfectly with YouTube as well and, I am sure with all other voice based apps. Voice input takes away the pain of typing.

Picture quality was quite good. Sound is not great.. But ok.. i brought the full HD variant not the 4k one. Amazon prime while installed needs to be logged in everytime you start the tv. This is quite irritating. Once logged in it works well.. Chrome casting is not that great.. Coming back to picture quality after a few days I began to notice some blue discolouration patches on the screen .. i thought maybe it was some static interference but it persisted after removing the home theatre that was in close proximity to the tv.. so requested for the TV to be taken back..,Amazon prime iSsues and screen issues,B07X413J1G
"Updated review: I got a call from the head of the service centre who promptly turned up in a day to address the issues Wall mount: Though it looks like two tacks and screws, he said it has been tested to bear weight and comes after a stringent quality check. The technician who came for installation was not supposed to discourage its use and sell us a mount. So the amount was refunded. Prime video: Apparently the set up needs to be done from a mobile. So the tv was reset and it was set up again using a mobile. The app also started after being registered through amazon prime on the laptop. The head who came explained and responded to all the questions I had about the tv. I had not expected such a prompt reply for a review as I had not even registered a complaint with the centre. Definitely impressed with the promptness.As of now, all the other features seem great as I have not used it long. And I would not hesitate recommending the purchase of this tv. It is well worth and a great purchase for the price Earlier review for which the problems were addressed : It has been only half a day that I have used this tv. It looks good, picture quality seems good enough, the audio quality is not so great at places as it seems to be blaring when songs play and dialogues are not very clear when playing a movie. Some of the apps like airtel tv and vodafone play are not available. Obviously not all apps that are on googleplay can be installed. The major disappointment was prime video app. I register the device on my computer but then on the tv, the screen still says there is a problem with the account and device registration. I could cast prime video from my phone though. I wish the tv resolves this issue as it proudly declares in the ad that prime video app is available on tv. The next problem was that of the wall mount provided. It looks very flimsy and the technician who came ( apparently they come from service centres which provide support, instead of any sanyo company centre), said the mount will be good enough only for 2 years and the company often provides such cheap mounts. He convinced me to buy a sturdy mount for 1100 rupees. Wish the company does not advertise free wall mount with the tv, when all it is going to provide are two tacks and two screws which do not look capable of holding a 5 kg tv. The TV also seems to respond slowly to the commands and the buttons of the remote. I will know more about its performance as the days go by. As of now, it satisfies my requirement of a smart tv.

"Writing this review after a month's usage. I was a bit skeptical before buying it as Sanyo is not enlisted among some of the other leading brands in television sector in the market. There were about 84 ratings when I first came across this product and now amazed to see it had crossed 1200+. Now coming back to the quality, both picture and sound quality are very good, not sure why some people have mentioned that sound isn't good, I think it is pretty adequate. Picture quality is amazing as well, offcourse don't compare it with the other brands which cost you 50k more than this one but it clearly serves purpose way better than its price. Moreover, it does provision all the smart features seamlessly, I have had no problems accessing any of the apps be it prime vedio, YouTube, Netflix etc. No issues with WiFi connectivity too. Having bought it at about 19k during the big billion sale, I think it's an amazing buy and it really serves its purpose. Next coming to the delivery, it was delivered as promised and also the installation was hassle free. Also, the customer care (Panasonic) is pretty responsive too. Go ahead and get it without a second thought, don't fall into the trap of other brands which are way expensive and not really worth.",Delivers what is promised!,B07X413J1G
"It's a good great TV among the big brands in the market. Picture quality is excellent with superb colours. Smart features are working fine. If you need a TV go for it without thinking much. The only thing need to improve is sound quality which is just average. After one month I am writing again about it. The TV is working well. It's a big TV in small budget. No matter of disappointment. Happy with my choice. The only one drawback is that when you paid it with Bluetooth you can't get a loud sound even when you keep all the sound levels ( tv , set top box and sound system) full.",Worth buying,B07X413J1G

"A great android tv.... Panasonic called within few hours of delivery for installation, great after sale service. Best thing is it has official android OS not android based OS. Built in chromecast, so it is easy to play your smartphone videos on tv. Google assistant ia great tool for search, no need to type. Has latest bluetooth 5.0, connectivity is great. 4K is great, no audio/video lagging. They can provide more ram but 1.75gb is ok. Amazon prime is not available in 4k model had to sideload but it works. I was unable to connect my bluetooth keyboard rest everything is great.",Best buy from trusted brand,B07X413J1G
"Hotstar, voot, netflix, you tube all world fine. Prime on tv is an issue. Thought via cast it works fine. For color and picture i think they are a little dark but good. I don't have any cable set top box connection. Video is of a movie from voot app. Chromecast works good. For Google voice assistance you need to pair the remote via Bluetooth first only the it will work. Lastlu voice is not clear, or either mine is a big from causing echo.

"I would recommend people to go for sanyo Kaizen series 43 inches over all other brands like VU , Mi, Kodak, Micromax , etc which are falling under the same price range . I googled the information almost for a week and then bought this TV during great Indian festival . Reasons are listed below- 1- Super bright LED( contrast ratio is Amazing ) 2-dolby audio (even at volume 4 you can watch all your serials ) but for music you can maximize as per you taste 3-Android certified (Google the difference between android certified and android based TV) 4- Android Pie 9.0 5- 1.75 GB ram 😃😃 6-Smooth functionality by remote with Google assistant. 7- Bluetooth 8-20 Watt speakers you will not need any additional home theatre 9-Dolby vision 10-HDR10 support 11-4K Resolution Guys I personally tested this TV even in day light with my window open and still I can see the colours looking so bright and clear . I can finally say thanks to Amazon for launching kaizen series in their platform.",Monster,B07X413J1G
"Sanyo 43 inch 4k smart tv is unbearable in its segment. Pros: Picture quality is nice & produce natural colors. Sound 2×10wts is also enough & good. Picture scaling is impressive Wifi Connectivity is quick & working nicely. 4k vedios running without leg. Comcast is one of the smart feature of tv. Goggle voice command Woking well. Apps are downloadable from playstore. Cons: Amazon prime is missing, hope that update come soon. Overall Sanyo 43 inch 4k smart tv is best as it is Japanese technology compare to other brand like LG, Samsung etc... Thanks Amazon for timely and safe delivery. Hassale free installation by Panasonic team, which also appreciable. Last word definitely go for it without any hassitation.","Nice and truly ""SMART TV""",B07X413J1G

No 3.5mm aux connector.. No hdmi arc So used the digital audio out but now TV volume cannot be set with TV remote. Need to use sound bar remote to adjust volume every time. Tv speakers are also working with sound bar simultaneously don't know why. I'm really hating this TV because of audio issues. Must have gone for iffalcon.,Worst audio connection ever,B07X413J1G
I was very septical to buy an HD ready TV Since I was using Samsung full HD tv. I am clad i went ahead and bought this TV after few hours of usage i don't find any different feel of watching HD ready.

"Bought Sanyo 43 Kaizen by this September and using it for some what 15 days, To be honest as it is described picture quality is quite amazing and plays HD and 4K videos the best and can be comparable with hight end TVs by Samsung LG etc. But sound is a bit disappointed. No that doesnt mean it is bad, its loud and clear but missing that Bass punch. Service from Panasonic is also on time and good. Over all in a budget range of 25K I must say Sanyo is best as compare to VU and others.",Its Awesome choice within 25K budget,B07X413J1G
"Overall it's a nice tv. Liked price and feature quality but only thing is lacking in this tv is LAN ethernet port is in wrong place, where it's not possible at all to plug our LAN ethernet cable. And about the wall mount, it's better for company not to provide that.",Nice Product,B07X413J1G
"Best Android TV. Before judging the picture quality run hd videos from Internet and cable TV, you can notice the difference if you have a high speed connection. Sound quality is awesome. Multicast works well. I had issues with Google voice assistant and Prime Video app login. It won't login so I am forced to multicast... I don't think everyone is facing this issue. Overall I give it a 5 out of 5 without any doubts whatsoever.",Simply awesome led Android TV,B07X413J1G
"My childhood friend is back..I remember we own BPL Sanyo CRT during my childhood.. BPL collaborated with Sanyo in early 80s..BPL is now a separate entity nd Sanyo gone with Panasonic.. Few years back while searching for a new TV online, I accidentally found BPL nd I bought it without any 2nd thought nd now searching again for 2nd TV for my bedroom nd really very accidentally found this Sanyo..Now I have BPL+Sanyo in my home ( My old memories ).. Coming to performance of Sanyo: Great colors, excellent picture quality, very detailed picture in 4 k, HD is superb.. Sound is not up to the mark..Bass is woo weak. Smart features: U just need a good and fast internet..That's it nd rest all the inbuilt software will take care.. Really ur family will enjoy these colors nd details. What messed up: A big black shade appears on the right side of the screen when ever u press controls/buttons like Home, volume etc..When I raised this issue, the company Sanyo sent me an email saying that the shade is nothing but OSD (On Screen Display) ( Big let down for Japanese Technology )..""NOW I CHALLENGE THEM TO SHOW ME THE SAME IN ANY OTHE BRANDED TVs in INDIA OR ABROAD. LACK OF GUTS TO ACCEPT THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE ISSUE IN THE BUILT-IN ITSELF. Very tough to operate voice search through Remote control..There is no mic in this remote as claimed by the company. u must shout loud to access it..😂😂😂😂 U cannot make changes in Sound detailed quality or Pic detailed quality during live .. u must go back pressing few controls and then u can do it and again need to come back to watch.. Conclusion: Apaprt from the shade issue, One of the well known branded, latest Android equipped, Clean 4K picture with many other full packed features coming with a very reasonable nd pocket friendly price..What else u need to watch a Smart 4K latest TV...Just go for it. As simple as that.. (Yes u will face a bit problem when a shade appears but it's fine if u can feel it's ok..).. Update on 23rd Oct: SOund quality getting better and better.. Can hear clear sounds now. Voice search: Not that great but now working fine .. Need to speak a bit loud to avail voice search. Picture: Getting better and better in HD and 4K.. SD is not upto the mark.. Update 30-Oct : Really enjoying the TV with my family.. Connectivity is superb no lagging.. Just u need a good internet and rest all assured",JUST BUY IT..JUST BUY IT..,B07X413J1G
"I am very careful with my electronic gadgets purchase. I researched on Samsung, LG and Sanyo Smart TV for more than 2 weeks before deciding on Sanyo TV. Same dimension with Samsung and LG but much less priced because of less brand recognition maybe!? I ordered this with lot of anxious thoughts because I didn't go for a bigger brand. I have used it extensively for last 1 month - mainly to watch HD Movies and Live Cricket.. and until now I have NO complaints. Amazing picture quality, amazing built in speakers and Smart TV features are splendid. The build quality, plastics used were all up to the mark. Has built in Wi-Fi so connect directly with your YouTube, Prime Video, Netflix and Hotstar. You can also use Vodafone Play, and other popular video streaming apps. And don't worry, Sanyo is a sister concern for Panasonic from Japan - so electronics quality will definitely be great. Plus, Panasonic provides the servicing for the product. Total value for money.",Total Value For Money.. Go for it!,B07X413J1G
"This is an excellent TV for the price. Picture quality merits 5 stars, & sound is quite good as well. I purchased a soundbar with subwoofer to go with it, & that has certainly added bass, depth & punch to the audio output. But even without the soundbar, the built-in speakers do a good job. Coming to the smart features, I've used Netflix & YouTube so far, and the experience is good. Netflix , in particular, is a breeze. YouTube takes a while to get used to, but that's the way YouTube is designed, nothing to do with the TV. Haven't tried other apps so far. The built-in Chromecast works perfectly, & casting from mobiles & my laptop works smoothly. I connected my old PC to the TV via a VGA to HDMi converter. I was prepared to be disappointed, but was pleasantly surprised. Even after passing through a budget converter, I am seeing PC visuals as I've never seen them before on a series of monitors. Bluetooth pairing of accessories takes somewhat longer than usual. At times, paired accessories (earphones, mobiles) do not work - music from mobiles cannot be sent to the TV, audio from TV does not output to Bluetooth wireless earphones. Unpairing & re-pairing the accessory is required to get things working again. Coming to delivery & installation, I'd ordered the TV on 29th September & selected 2nd October as date of delivery. But the TV was not delivered that day. That afternoon, I received an SMS saying that the delivery team had been unable to contact me & therefore delivery would be done next day.The SMS had a mobile number of the delivery person for me to contact. I spent that entire afternoon & evenining and next morning and afternoon trying that number. It was either switched off or no one would receive the call. On a few occasions someone received the call and, presumably, just kept the phone to one side leaving me going ""Hello, hello, hello..."" till I gave up in frustration and hung up. Finally I was forced to twice contact Amazon Customer Service who raised a complaint. The TV was finally delivered on the 4th. I got a call about installation the next day, and the installation man came on the 6th as arranged. The physical installation (wall mounting) was done efficiently. But he was rather casual about the setup, telling me I could easily do it myself later. Basically, he started the TV, showed me the Home screen, the Netflix button on the remote, told me briefly about using Google Assistant voice features, & left it that. As a first-time smart TV user, it took me the best part of a day with the manual to start using the TV with any sense of purpose. To sum up, I'm quite satisfied with the TV per se and would have given it 5 stars but for the poor delivery and installation experience.","Excellent TV, poor delivery",B07X413J1G
"I decided to buy this TV for playing ps4. The product quality is great whereas the sound and video quality is good but not great. When you play a 60fps video file or play PS4 games (not PS4 pro) it doesn't look like wat it is. There is some minor lag which can be clearly noticed. Even when u watch a YouTube video which has Full HD resolution and 60fps in the smartphone, we won't see any lag. I didn't expect this from a Panasonic brand. The display seems to be over bright and it hurts the eyes. I tried to change the picture settings but it didn't helped me. Regarding sound, this TV has 20W speakers. The sound is loud. However, when u watch a movie or play a game, it's very hard to hear what the character speaks. Iam planning to return than product. Edit (9-10-2019) There are few software bugs in the TV - Amazon prime gets logged out when you restart the TV - when a video is playing if you use volume control button, the videos is getting fast forwarded for one second - mobile cannot be connected through usb - any Bluetooth can be connected to the TV but if the TV is restarted, the paired device is not getting connected automatically to the TV.",Good product but not great though,B07X413J1G

"Please dont go for this TV. 1. Reason is when you increase or decrease the volume, automatically the video playing in YouTube or Amazon Prime or Netflix gets fast forwarded to 5 seconds ahead, disturbing the whole flow. 2. You will have to login & register everytime you watch a movie or video in Amazon Prime. 3. The Brightness, Conrast, Sound setups are reset to default even if you keep changing everytime. 4. Even after calling Sanyo Service Centres numerous times or giving negative feedbacks there is no response because they have received my payment. 5.

"Firstly I have issues with the TV, the audio and video sync is not correct and the optical connector is lose and it always falling down. The major issue is the support of 4K video, though it is said to be 4K TV it does not support HDCP 2.2 hence from Amazon Fire TV 4K Stick it can only play Full HD. Amazon misleading the customer with out providing the correct description of the product as with the lack of 4K support it can not be considered as 4K TV. Smart features are OK and the remote is so inconvenient to use with the TV, the picture quality is just average and voice recognition doesn't work always.

"After my experience with CloudWalker, which also promised same things (in fact lesser), but 4K video, android TV etc. I realised many gaps which starts to frustrate one as you get comfortable with the TV. The biggest value for me on this TV is the startup time - the picture is up and ready to go within 20 seconds! There is smooth integration with Netflix and other apps (am still waiting for Primevideo), Korean TV that my kids are crazy about. There is NO lag on ANY of the apps, video is smooth. A real pleasure to watch. The basic expectation on picture is easy - I have no great expectations, but this TV gives terrific pictures, even with back light (I have a window opposite the TV which was a problem with older TV). Andriod TV was something I realised I needed to demand - older TV had a hacked version of plain vanilla android and it does not work out so well. Sound quality is neat, no great shakes, but as I usually connect to my HD system, this is moot. In any case the TV sound is clear, used upto 75% and seen no problems. Voice recognition was never on my list, but having seen and used this, now I can stop the ""typing"" - still getting used to it, voice recognition seems a bit off, but not bad at all. Another surprise for me is the BlueTooth - works very smoothly with many devices (headphones) I connected - only wish we have a ""broadcast"" bluetooth so 3/4 headphones can be connected simultaneously. I strongly recommend this for all ""normal"" TV users over even Samsung/LG/Sony at this price range.",Smart TV that simply works - Buy It!!,B07X413J1G
"Received the TV as promised on the date. For installation received call on the delivery day and was installed on the same day. Picture clarity is very good as it is a 4K TV. It has got 3 HDMI ports & 2 USB ports. A / V input to TV is a EP socket, converter cable RCA to EP, is in the package. Set Top Box is connected through this cable. The quality of picture is limited to the quality of cable connection. You can connect external sound system via Bluetooth and HDMI. I have connected through Bluetooth.

Flawless connectivity with chromecast, screenshare never felt this easy and fast. Only flaw i found was the ports (USB, HDMI, etc) were hard to reach once wall mounted but that's just knitpicking. Overall a good experience, will update later after some time.",Best TV in the price range,B07X413J1G
"I purchased the 43inch Modal. After going through all the features mentioned in the description, reading questions answered in the Q&A section and reading some reviews the one final thing which was the decision point was the company name. Sanyo is brand name of Panasonic and my past experience with Panasonic was always great. Great sound quality, not like one of those high-value home theatre systems but better than other TV options that i have seen. Latest Android and on time updates and patchs. In 43 inch modal Amazon Prime Video was not included but with new update its available now. Chromecast works great and allows you to stream your mobile and other devices on TV without any lagging or issue. In my view its best value for money product.",Better than expected!,B07X413J1G
"***Service*** I have recieved TV which has some software issue. Somashekhar (Panasonic Technisian) was able to resolve the issue quickly. I really appreciate his commitment towards customer satisfaction and going beyond and analyzing the root cause of issue as it very recently released product. After the fix, TV is working perfectly. All my doubts got clarified. ****TV**** TV looks so stylish and sound from two speakers coming so clearly. It has many more smart features than I expected. TV turning ON very quickly. Apps performance is Good. Watched 4K videos in YouTube 😍 What else I want for 23.5K ( offer price ). I can easily say this is best TV for that budget. ***Cons*** *TV remote should have been better quality (though it has all button). YouTube button is not present. * Badly waiting for Amazon Prime. It is currently unavailable.",Good TV - Great Service,B07X413J1G
65inches sanyo was delivered promptly by Amazon on the 8th of Nov but no one has turned up for installation yet from Sanyo. Since 4 days I have been contacting to various toll free numbers of Sanyo for which I get excuses and sorry for which there is no meaning. Finally left with no choice I had to do the installation myself with my own risk. If installation itself is like this We need not think of their promising warranties. Anyways those purchasing a product from Sanyo forget about installations and warranties.,Worst customer service,B07X413J1G
After 5 days still no installation.No help from Amazon and also from Sanyo. Return period is 22nd I dont think it will be done by them.Regretting buying large appliances from Amazon their competitor are better. Very Dissatisfied customer,Very Dissatisfied customer,B07X413J1G
"Picture quality is very good, it look like 4K quality Sound system is normal, should not expect more for 7K price Netflix, prime videos and other apps are working very good, initially prime was not getting registered but after resetting it is very well working After running multiple apps, I've not noticed any hanging. Only thing is voice recognition is not up to mark, need some improvement",Excellent TV with this price range,B07X413J1G
"Major drawback 1. TV asks to power off in every 3 hrs. 2. Everytime TV gets power on it shows scan channel. 🤣 WTF 3. Power savings rating - 1* (that's worst for Panasonic brand ) Only option good is it's a smart TV. OS is quite slow. I suggest, opt for other brands, it's a cheap brand in the name of Panasonic. Don't go for the reviews friends. The reviews are fake. Go for MI or VU.","Cheap quality, high power consumption. Go for other brands.",B07X413J1G
"Picture quality of this tv is very good. There are various picture modes including vivid and energy savings, which I frequently switch between. Android TV experience is mesmerizing. I have bought a bluetooth gamepad to play games, awesome gaming experience. Sound quality is also very good. Regarding the delivery and installation, everything was done so smoothly by the amazon and Panasonic team. If you are looking for 32 inch smart tv at this price point, just go for it. I compared this tv with mi tv, yet bought this giving Rs. 500 more than mi tv. I am still happy with that choice. There is one thing I did not like about is the energy rating. I got the tv with 1 star rating, expectation was 3 stars. Bought during great Indian sell, applied every discount, cashback, offer, cost came around Rs. 9300. Enjoying it.","Enjoying Android tv with great display and sound, at this low cost.",B07X413J1G

"Over two weeks of usage, my take - - Display panel is crisp and bright. 4K content runs smooth and is pleasant to watch. - Speakers are loud, lacks bass. - OS is fast and stable, no crashes so far. Booting up takes time. Although, with fast boot enabled, it takes a second. - Wireless supports 2.4GHz, lacks 5GHz. - Remote reception is solid. Voice recognition is good to have, takes getting used to. Overall experience is good. Worth the buy.",Worth the buy! Good product from SANYO!,B07X413J1G
Overview. 1) Brazzel for saying is thin 2mm in sides and 1 cm at lower level but since led screen is less by 1cm on all sides hence it hardly matters. 2)Cast feature where ever available at andoid app e.g voot works fine but for apps working need to check. 3) You tube working fine . 4) Google Assistant needs to be activated from tv settings for remote and remember remote consumes battery at fast pace. 5) Speakers : Hmm i have LG smart tv 2013 model it was expensive that time so comparing that didn't like the sound and Dolby.Now what to do suggest to adjust the sound from settings as per your liking with Bass &Treble. Or Attach 2.1 computer speakers they would improve. Installation & Service: Good Panasonic Network.Not to worry for 1 year. Overall Ok at the price.,Santo Kaizon 32 inch review.,B07X413J1G
"Picture Quality : I will give 5/5 to its picture quality.This is something you will never regret.Better colour reproduction, greater colour accuracy, wider viewing angles but screen loses brigthness slightly when viewed from side angle but Image is acurate. Cons: in-Built Chromecast :- Not satisfied with in-Built Chromecast as it lags. Audio and video signals out of sync even when you cast directly from apps.don't expect that it will performe like dedicated google chromecast dongle. Sound Quality : Satisfied with sound quality.loud enough. Smart Feature: I m OK with app support.all preinstalled apps like youtube etc work fine I have not tried prime video so can not comment on it.User interface is good no lag whatsoever.Apps can be sideloaded. Voice recognition function works smoothly Final Comment :- Its budget smart TV better than other local brands as it is manufactured and supported by Panasonic. Recommended for :- those who prefer to watch normal TV viewing like TV serials,movie,news etc Not recommended:- for sports,games, and high action lovers as it create blur effect in fast action scenes because of low panel response time.",Its budget smart TV better than other local brands,B07X413J1G
"Really good product. Really worth the amount and picture quality looks amazing. You can always trust Japanese quality standards. The stand of the TV looks elegant. Only small feedback is regarding the sound quality. It's not bad, but could have been better. Otherwise no complaints. Can buy this without doubting. And the installation was a breeze and they called twice to get my feedback. Panasonic are hell bent on capturing the market share. Hope its a durable product as well!!",Value for money!

Few people in comment section mention audio is low. I can say it is more than enough. If you want to play music for society, then it is not sufficient.

"I do not have money to buy right now. But I have participated in the Amazon quiz to get this great lead. Whenever I get time, I watch a movie with my friend at her home on this led. Heart becomes happy",I love sanyo,B07X413J1G
"Nice TV. Initially, could not connect to Amazon Prime Video even after several attempts. However, as mentioned in the previous comments by SANYO, need to Reset the TV in order to use the Prime Video app login with your account.. When I chose to reset, it shows some update is going on, but won't be knowing how much percentage done or how much time left for the update completion or even don't know what is going on. So, I just waited for about 20 minutes and it still showed the same screen. I stopped the update at the moment. After doing this, just opened the Prime Video app and connected to my account without any issue. VESA screws type is different for this TV when compared to the ones I used it on my Samsung TV used earlier. And Installation person brought appropriate screws to fix it on my existing wall mount on the same day of delivery..",Worth it's price. Voice enabled Remote works well. Smart features are good.,B07X413J1G
Great value for money. Pros 1. Great picture quality. 4k videos look stunning. Even SD and 720p videos looks good. 2. Fast delivery and Installation. 3. Easy to use interface. 4. Latest android. 5. Slim design and minimal bezels. Cons 1. Amazon prime video is missing. Can't understand Why? 2. Poor remote. 3. Below average Sound quality. DTS not supported. Sound bar can solve this problem. 4. Black levels are not great but acceptable. So far all is good.,Nice TV,B07X413J1G
"Won't get disappointed. The best in the market among all those Chinese counterpart. Fastest delivery of Amazon, within a day installation. Some may get jargogle about the price when compared to the Chinese one. But believe the Japanese standard and panasonic service. My hall unit is a panasonic it's been with for nearly 7 years, till now no problem and haven't did any service. That's the power of japenese product and Sanyo got that legacy without a doubt. So definetely 4 star from me.",The best out there in the e-commerce market. ASSURED!!!,B07X413J1G
"Well, I am not a tech savvy guy. But let me put forth my views about this TV. While ordering a tv online and given so many options these days, I was really confused while placing the order. I wanted a good 4k tv for my bedroom. After flitting across on various ecommerce sites, I had this option of opting for either motorola or lg or samsung or Vu premium tv. Further, I have always been a very loyal customer of lg, so despite checking all the options again and again, I would come back to LG, but somehow while placing the order i chose this tv and i am really happy with my decision. I got this tv delivered on the auspicious day of dhanteras and got it installed the same day by the Panasonic technicians. GOOD JOB, AMAZON AND PANASONIC.The product was delivered on time and due care was taken while shipping this product by amazon. This 43"" 4k tv is just a show stealer in this price segment. Picture quality is just awesome. As I wanted this tv for my bedroom, so I had not connected this with tata sky. I made this an internet tv which runs smoothly on my fibernet broadband. Coming back to the review about this tv, look wise it looks sturdy, very thin bezels ( plastic, I feel it was done by the manufacturer to cut on the cost), sturdy back body, IPS display, 3 hdmi, 2 usbs, connects smoothly to the internet once it is powered on. Similarly connectivity to bluetooth devise is also smooth and connects automatically once powered on. Like all other smart TVs, this tv too has many useless apps which simply fills the interface and comes with only few useful preloaded apps like YouTube, hotstar, zee5, google play store (option very limited), google music, etc. You cannot add amazon prime ( you can cast though from your mobile) and other chrome cast compatible apps can also be cast on this tv which once configured works just smoothly. While switching between the apps, tv responds quickly with no lagas or latency issue. I was a bit disappointed with the sound though as it's very average, but when I got it connected with other bluetooth devices including my speakers i could feel the attributes of Dolby. I personally suggest adding external speakers to this tv for rich viewing experience. Further, I am yet to check this tv on tata sky with the hd channels and even the SD channels, but who cares, I don't even want to use these on this tv. Remote look wise is average, but its sturdy made of good quality plastic. The google assistance and voice search works just fine. You need to be a little slow and clear while giving commands, which is understandable. Therefore, if you are looking for a good budget 4k ultra hd tv in this price segment, go for it guys, without any second thought. Like I said if you have external bar speakers or surround sound, this combo can prove to be very deadly for you, it's just amazing. So what are you waiting for when you can have this beauty for just under 30k ( I got this at INR 25000). Wish you all a happy watching. ✌ And yes, one star i have deducted becoz of the inbuilt sound and the cheap bezels, the manufacturer have used for this tv, else i don't have any regrets. So enjoy !","Awesome tv in this price segment, amazon and Panasonic rock ✌",B07X413J1G
"I have some apprehensions before buying this TV(43inches Kaizen Series HD Ready Smart Certified Android IPS LED XT-43A082U (Black) (2019 Model). I just took a chance and ordered it. But I am now happy that I have made a good decision. I am satisfied with all the features in this budget. In the lower segment of price this TV is the best among other TVs(after weeks of research). Panasonic service people called me and installed it in the very next day of delivery with free of cost. Those who are confused in the lower price segment smart TVs, I would say you can go for it. It is really paisa vasool!",value for money,B07X413J1G

"I’ve recently purchased the SANYO Kaizen 43” TV and I must say it’s the most value for money gadget I’ve ever spent on! Key Points and my views on that #1 - 4K: The picture quality is exceptional. You just can’t keep your eyes off the enchanting display quality. #2 - Design: WOW is the first word that comes to your mind when you talk about design. It’s Bezel less design adds the wow factor to the overall immersive experience, whilst adding a dash of style to the living room. #3 - Chromecast: The TV comes with built-in Chromecast where you can cast your phone directly on to big screen. #4 - Sound: It comes with Dolby Digital Audio and it does provide a theatre like experience when I’m on a binging spree. #5 - Apps: Prime video & Netflix are supported natively in the TV where you can enjoy hours of content easily. Also, there’s Google Play store where you can download your favorite apps and enjoy them all. #6 - Intuitive watching experience The remote with hot keys is a super simple experience, so much so that my 4 year old can navigate the UI like a pro. All in all, it does provide an ultimate Android TV experience.",Definitely recommended!,B07X413J1G
"I searched these tvs VU,MI & SANYO... as VU is NEW and does not have customer service in my city i didnt selected & for MI i found -ve reviews & no customer service not able to consider this too..and SANYO is from PANASONIC i trusted this & Earlier i have good customer help for my PANASONIC AC. so i preferred this & it is the Best 32inch TV in this Price Range..Voice assistant working Awesome, Picture quality is Superb,Web browsing is Fast. Dolby sound is Excellent... Worth the Money which we spend Panasonic Guy not able to explain all features in this TV , He just only installed TV. Still not able to install CHROME or LIVE TV in my set..if anybody know if explains its good. Please don't listen to people saying Prime Video not Working may be their TV is old. My TV is 100% working good with every feature as mentioned in product",BEST TV value for money,B07X413J1G
"TV is absolutely very good, especially picture and sound quality is awesome which you normally see in high end TVs costing above 2-3 Lakh. As of now I am very happy and satisfied with Sanyo. Two drawbacks I observed, 1. Amazon prime inbuilt is not there,we have to chrome cast. 2. Voice recognizing is not good(3 🌟). I don't understand why it is not mentioned that, it is a UHD 4k TV any where on TV or packing box. Even technician suspected that is it 4k. Please someone have any idea about it , please comment. Let me see down the line for few days and will update the review how it is. Overall it's value for money.",Fantastic picture and sound Quality. 5 🌟 .,B07X413J1G
"Best Budget TV, Good Panel, Prime Video not available even though sold through amazon but can be cast through built-in chrome cast, have to ask them whether they plan on pushing it through an update. SD channels(no loss in picture quality) good. Good Contrast tuned it, IPS Panel does the job but don't expect deep blacks not an Oled. Instead of 1.75Gb ram & 8Gb rom, 16Gb rom & 2Gb ram would have been a good improvement for all 4K Versions.",5 star. On festival offer TV had 4k discount.,B07X413J1G
The TV runs fine as long as it runs but it keeps restarting after a while. When SANYO technicians came over they were not very sure what was wrong. One said it is a motherboard issue and another said it was a hardware issue. is anybody else facing the issue of restart?,Not sure if product is good,B07X413J1G
It doesn't have more app like jio tv and many other apps. Cast your tv function does not work at all. Picture quality is very bad. I am unable to install jio tv and other apps. When I run any app it does not run smoothly. I think it is not better tv only good,Plz clear all your wishes and questions before buying this tv,B07X413J1G

"I was familiar with products of Sanyo and was happy to go with the brand. I have no regrets. The picture quality is the main talking point as is the overall finish and service. What was good: 1. Picture quality. A little tuning (turn down the sharpness) gives you premium image quality at a budget price. Great image quality. 2. Service: Amazon delivered the next day and Sanyo (Panasonic) installed the day after. The product came safely packaged and the wall installation went of very smoothly. The technician left my house at 10pm - that is the sort of dedication I can pay money for. I got a follow up call from Sanyo two days later to find out if installation went well and if I was happy with the product. What more can you ask for! 3. Android and Chromecast: Chromecast works perfectly. I can cast Prime Video and watch without any glitches. I have also connected headphones and speakers effortlessly with Bluetooth. Android works well but with some issues that needs sorting out. 4. Finish: The product is not flashy. It has a dignified appearance and can go with any decor. What can be Better: 1. Software. I have major issues with the ""input"" button as it does not take me to the TV connection. I have to switch to TV from the ""Source"" button. This needs a software update fix. The technician was unable to fix the issue. 2. Some apps do not work - ZEE5, for example, does not open. Maybe it is an issue with ZEE, but it is frustrating. 3. The sound quality is good but not great. It is an issue with most budget down-firing speakers and my premium Panasonic TV also suffers from this problem. I listen through a soundbar, so it is not a big issue for me - but buyers should be aware of this minor shortcoming. The negatives do not take away from the sheer enjoyment of watching quality content at less than Rs 25K - so I will rate this TV ""5 Star"" in its segment.","Best budget 43"" 4K Smart TV",B07X413J1G
"Brilliant product at such a low price point! ONLY DRAWBACK is that there is ONLY 1 nos. Audio Out (Digital Audio Out) in the TV. So, ONLY 1 person can use headphones via bluetooth to watch TV without distracting the children studying in the house etc. Second pair of headphones will NOT pair with the TV via bluetooth. Because of this, my Tewtross Bluetooth transmitter device which can supply audio to TWO pairs of headphones by connecting to my old LCD TV via the standard 3.5mm Headphones Out jack has now become useless. The obvious workaround this problem now is to keep the AV receiver / Amplifier switched on all the time the TV is on, and feed the Digital Audio Out from this TV into the Amp and then connect the Tewtross Bluetooth Transmitter to the Amp to feed two sets of headphones via Bluetooth. Irritating! What was the big cost savings to Sanyo not to provide a piddly 3.5mm headphones jack in this 43""TV?? Such a disappointment over such a small item.",Limitation in Audio Out options!!,B07X413J1G
On time delivery. Installation within one and half hour after delivery. Two engineers came for installation. Knowledgeable persons. Excellent picture quality. Need some setting changes for sound. Then you will get the good sound. Casting ok but some lagging. Google Assistant work well. No issue on remote. Need a HD connection for dth/cable for better viewing. No issue on wifi. YouTube working fine. 4k videos are excellent. Go for it. After all it's a Panasonic product.,Awesome 👍,B07X413J1G
Picture quality is acceptable for the price. It is slighly yellowish. Pixel density is good given 4K UHD for 43 inch screen size. Prime videos is missing but you can side load with apk with armv7 version and it will work fine. Sound is loud and clear. Installation was so-so as I called twice and eventually I got it installed with my trusted Electrician on flexible mount. You can go with this 4k Android TV if your budget is very tight.,Good for the Price,B07X413J1G

"I initially wanted to buy Mi 4x tv, but it is rarely available for sale.. So I was in search of a 43 inch 4k tv and same time it was rigorously advertised on Amazon.in...I thought it meets my requirement and to my surprise, it actually does. Picture quality is amazing, 4k videos run smoothly (need good internet speed though). Sounds quality is good enough. Overall tv performance is really good...I even checked the comparison of Mi tv and this one, the latter had got better reviews ( Sanyo has ips display). Overall this is a good buy and I'm enjoying it...BTW I got this at 23,250 during sale.",Amazing 4k tv,B07X413J1G

Received a defective product which has green dots on the screen when turned on. I have been behind Amazon since the day I received this TV to have it replaced but they keep pushing back. Literally awful support from Amazon. They are just waiting for the replacement period to get over. I’m having a horrid time speaking to the cust executives and no responses on mail as well. Most of the functions in the TV are good but I don’t think it is as great as hyped about. My advice would be to go for Blaupunkt through flipkart.,Defective Product and Pathetic support,B07X841RGL
"Most probably, the MI TV 4X 50 inch is having VA Panel. There is no way to find out whether it is IPS/VA, at least from the Menu. The display is very good, except for the light bleeding in complete dark area or scene. This will not affect your viewing experience. User interface especially menu is a bit tricky. One useful feature is it remembers the last input source. So if you are watching TATASKY-->Switch off --> Switch On --> The source last played will be selected by default. HDMI ARC is working fine, but getting the ARC through the Yamaha Receiver (HTR3067) was a herculean task. Android TV is good. Prime Video starts and plays without any hiccup from the Remote. I have got it on the first day sale for Rs.27000/- (SBI Offer + Amazon Cashback). The TV is total value for the money. Esp 4K HDR 50 inch display at this price with reasonably good build quality is excellent. Reduced one star because of the basic remote (No mute button) and No standby mode. If you switch off from Remote, the TV shuts down (No standby) and restarts from the scratch if you switch on again. I heard that the you can take it to standby mode through voice command, yet to test that part. Update 17.10.2019: There is a provision to keep TV on standby. Press and hold the power button.

"1) Picture -3.5/5 -IPS panel was expected. Though its a decent LED panel but IPS panel could have been better option to go with 50"" and above size. 2) Sound -3/5 - Could have been better. Sound Quality and Loudness are average. 3) UI and OS - 4/5 - Patchwall 2.0 with Android Official Store is Better than LG and Samsung OS and UI. 4) Installation - 4/5 - Expected Free wall mount . Installation was Free of cost and Hassle free. Mount is chargeable. Fixed wall Mount will cost you ₹499 and SWIVEL wall Mount will cost ₹1399. 5) Overall VFM - 3.5/5 - Only Drawbacks are Above Average picture quality which is Slightly lower than LG , Motorola, Samsung TV and Average sound quality. Motorola is best choice and best VFM with IPS and better Sound output under ₹35k for 50"" 4K TV and 55"" 4k under ₹40k",TV is good for price BUT was expecting a better TV with better Sound and IPS panel.,B07X841RGL
"The tv was working as intended for just 12 days after that the display got faulty( just after ten days replacement warranty has over),even though there is the warranty for the display .Mi service guys asking 25000 for the repair of the same,it all seems like a cruel joke. Do not know what to do,if you contact amazon they are diverting the call to MI service center and they are parroting the same line again and again",Tv display faulty exactly after twelve days!!! service charge 25k tv price 29k,B07X841RGL
"Fantastic is the word which can describe this TV. This is totally wireless TV. JioTV runs like a charm. You can always install AirTel xtreme TV app. If you buy MI IR cable, there is no need for any other remote. 4K quality is awesome. Only thing I felt under performing is the number of less USB ports. There are only 2, MI IR cable has occupied one and Bluetooth mouse has occupied the other. Now I cannot attach the External HDD. Wish it could have more USB ports.",MI TV is my TV,B07X841RGL

Like: Price Dislike: picture quality is Very average. The picture frames appear to slow even when watching a 60 fps video. Whenever sequences having light or fast action it will blur out specific area. You will not get any Upscaling. Sound is also average would suggest buy a soundbar. Guys who can increase budget go for Samsung/ LG/ Panasonic/ Sharp. Guys with the same budget can consider Vu over this.,Budget TV nothing special,B07X841RGL
"Lots of positive-negative comments are here regarding MI 4X , but my overall experience is awesome with this TV either it is sound quality, picture quality or delivery/installation support. Sound quality and picture quality both are perfect , infact more than my expectations from 30k UHD TV. Dont know about other smart TV model/brand under price of 30k , but this one have dual band wifi with both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz capacity. Although I have high speed internet connection and get connected this TV by Ethernet , data saver is not an issue for me neither I tried nor I checked. Till now only problem/issue I face is that Amazon prime video with Bluetooth headphones not working in this TV , may be resolved after update. Else must buy product from MI and highly recommend to all. Thanks","Awesome product from MI, highly satisfied",B07X841RGL
This one is the best in segment smart TV but the sad thing is it does not have IPS panel and Data saving mode option is missing. Viewing angle are not up-to 178 we can notice color bleed in different angles... SD video seems not bad but HD videos has really great. I have to do manual picture settings to see good picture quality.... So called vivid mode is totally waste. One thing that disappointed me is while watching HD TV channel with Dolby digital sound on Bluetooth headset no sound can be heared ... Only after changing sound settings to PCM audio we can listen... I think in next update it will be fixed. Overall it has good built quality.,Good but know this before buying it,B07X841RGL
"1. Picture quality is amazing i am using tata sky setup box and its too good in picture quality. Also at 4k video u will truely amazed its too good with no lags depending on u r internet speed. 2. Sounds quality is also good & clear but if u want theater like experience then i will recommend to buy mi sound bar . I am sure u will love this combo. 3. Its a value for money also 1. it support Netflix, Amazon prime,hotstar,zee5 & many more. 2. the patchwall experience is good,easy interface and smooth. 3. It has built in Chromecast,screen mirror, Bluetooth, hotspot,2 themes,etc 4. Install apps from play store & don't install any app which has too many ads. 5.There is a app 'CetusPlay' in which u can get remote control,gamepad,mouse for u r t.v. in mobile for more information watch YouTube video on CetusPlay app. Some cons 1.Screen mirror has lag but not that much noticeable. 2. Same with Chromecast if the internet speed is slow it will buffer but if the speed is good then it will be fine. :- Till now i don't get any problem or more cons on this t.v.

Bluetooth headset doesn't work along with Amazon prime!!! Sound quality is quite bad. Installation was done only 7 days after delivery since that was the earliest availability. Installer will try to sell the movable wallmount by saying you can't reach behind the TV. But actually you can reach behind even with the non movable mount.,Consider LG TVs seriously before you buy this as the customer support is non existent,B07X841RGL
"My 1st andriod tv. Was excited on the day of delivery as my old tv had stoped working 3 days ago. But the executives who had come for installation were not cooperative. I had my old tv on the wall and i asked them to just remove it and put this in that place, they said it wasnt in their policy and we are getting late to deliver other customers tv(One plus tv worth 55k) mentioning this to me. After wasting 10mins i offerred them 200Rs for it and they happily did it. Like seriously we are buying a 30k tv and getting this kind of service. And they charge 500rs for the wall mount installation. Its written in boldd letters which i saw later. total money spend Rs.30,700. Still worth it for the picture quality.",Best in this price segment. But the fitting Service is bad.,B07X841RGL
"Picture is not at all of 4k quality even when you play 4k video. MI is a cheap brand. I suggest don't buy this TV. Either MI or Amazon is fooling really. If you wanna buy a quality TV, go to a local store, check, inquire and buy. Sound is pathetic. Volume is so low even when it is played at maximum level. This is my honest review after using the product for 15 days I would rather go to a local electronic store like bajaj elec or reliance or croma instead of buying from mi or even on Amazon or even Flipkart.

It is a good value for money TV... Picture Quality is great...Downsides are sound and start time for me...overall is a a great TV for 30k.....I got the TV installed the same day it was delivered (thank you Amazon..I did not expect that).....I was confused with a lot of options VU Motorola TCL however I chose MI in the end the differences between all these brands are marginal only proper techies can notice it also how much you actually want to pay for a TV depends on your budget; MI for me personally has more service centres and though it may take time will service my product which I cannot be sure of the other brands I mentioned....if you a want true 4K picture buy OLED TVs from Sony LG dont buy this TV can compare....,A value for money TV,B07X841RGL
Guys pls check whether this is an LED or LCD. because when you touch the screen with your finger you can see the ripples on the screen. It should not happen for LED tv. This is cheating. Mi is marketing with lower quality which will work until guarantee period ends that's it. I don't feel it is worth for money. Im disappointed after installing the TV. Better go with some other brands adding another 4 k.,Not worth for money...,B07X841RGL

"Dec'19 after one month of usage i liked below features: 1. Awesome Picture quality for 1080 up-scaling and 4k contents 2. UHD and HDR works for all popular content providers(netflix & Amazon Prime) 3. No 3.5 mm jack so you may have to reply on bluetooth/SPIDF/ARC for external speakers (using TP-Link HA100 I attached my old sound system to TV via bluetooth) 4. Patch wall sucks - generate recommendations whose subscriptions i don't have ( removed as primary and using default one) 5. you can connect Mouse to TV to navigate the UI 6. Using Remote control App and chrome cast feature is breeze 7. Remote lacks multiple features like mute / screen off button 8. Jio TV works but not a good thing, try ThopTV",short honest review,B07X841RGL
"Short opinion- This is probably the best 4K TV you can buy under 30K. So, go for it without any further thought. Long opinion- I got this TV in the first sale and though I was bit skeptical at first but after using it for more than a week I can say it is the best TV that I have bought. The picture quality is stunning to say the least specially when you play 4K content from YouTube app. 1080p content also looks pretty good and not pixelated. I have compared the picture quality to TCL 4K TV's but Mi was the clear winner here. Speakers are bottom firing and quite loud for a medium sized room. The audio is clear but don't expect bass. If you need bass then connect a soundbar or speaker system. S/PDIF and HDMI ARC is present, so you are covered on the audio front. Google assistant and Chromecast works flawlessly and without any lag. Since the OS is Android 9(Pie) all the apps are latest and updated frequently. Patchwall is easy to use and there is enough content for everyone to watch. Remote is somewhat similar to fire stick remote in size but with additional buttons of Google assistant, Netflix and prime video. Easy to understand and easy to use. The installation took few mins. Both the installation guy and delivery guy arrived at the same time so thumbs up for Mi installation team. Two things to note, TV doesn't come with wall mount so you will have to pay 500₹ to installation guy for the wall mount and remote batteries aren't included in the package so you will have to buy them separately. It is REALLY HARD to find flaws in this TV.",Best 4K TV under 30K,B07X841RGL
"Really happy with this launch, I was about to buy Samsung in the Great Indian Festival but got to know that MI is launching this TV, was little skeptical but then changed my mind and I bought it. And guess what , I took the right decision , its an awesome TV and got me 20k rupees saved in comparison to Samsung for the same item...Durability is still a question to me but cant comment on that as of now....will review again after at least 6 months of uses. Go for it if your budget is around 30k....best in the market","50"" 4k TV at this price (unbelievable)",B07X841RGL
So i want to start this review by saying that this tv is total bang for bucks the tv is super snappy and fast. I mostly use this tv for gaming on my PS4 and the games looks good i can say i previously had a mi tv 4a 43 inch and it does not support hdr but this tv does so a plus point for that even the picture quality is pretty good for this price i watched some 4k movies and they look good. If were to nit pick i can say that the speakers are bad yes they do not sound that good i can even say that the previous mi tv sounded better than this tv. I don't know what is wrong with the speakers but they sound quite boring. Anyways i think you can go for this tv i don't regret buying this tv for this price.,A balanced tv with more pros and less cons. #bangforbucks,B07X841RGL

"Updates: 1. The remote power button issue was due to some HDMI / CEC setting. It is sorted now. Google's Android TV Design team should show what the impact of changing a Setting is. 2. The no - audio issue is not as frequent anymore. 3. The audio output when connected to external speakers is weirdly bad. The audio given out by my Fire Stick over Bluetooth is much much better, both in terms of quality & volume, than when my TV gives the audio out to the same external speakers (same issue via Bluetooth and S/PDIF). ---- After thinking a lot to decide between TCL iFfalcon, Motorola, Vu and Mi TVs, I decided to go ahead with the Mi. My idea was Mi is a reasonably respected brand, and they have a lot of service centres. TV is something I will use for a long period of time, and I want the brand to exist to service in the long term. WHAT I LIKED: 1. The colors on the TV seem fairly good. 2. The audio quality seemed quite good too (I watch from ~ 8 ft). 3. The remote is well laid out and is nice to use. 4. It comes with a S/PDIF digital audio output. With more expensive speakers, you can easily connect you’ll need to purchase a digital to analog converter (DAC) to connect most 2.1 speakers. WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER: 1. Less than 3 weeks, and the Power button on the Remote stopped working. This is disappointing. (FIXED) 2. The TV sometimes stops playing audio. To fix it, I have to restart the TV. (ALMOST FIXED) 3. With the TV connected to my Bluetooth speakers, sometimes there is a lag. 4. The content from my 1080p Fire Stick & 1080p Chromecast looks bad on the TV. Must be an upscaling issue. Surprisingly, content from the same devices looks much better on a friend’s 55 inch Mi 4K TV. 5. There is no 3.5mm audio jack on the TV.",Picture quality & Audio are good.,B07X841RGL
Very fast delivery and loved the picture quality. Overall i liked it. Thanks amazon and mi,I loved it,B07X841RGL
"I bought the Mi TV 4X 50' from on flash sale. Got it during the second time I got opportunity after being waitlisted. It was a good deal for a 50' TV. After the discount + cashback in the credit card the price was Rs. 26900. I’ve been using this TV for the past two weeks and I must say it’s the most value for money gadget I’ve ever spent on! In 2008 or so we bought a 26' LCD TV for Rs. 25000. Technology has advanced so fast and see how is the market nowadays. Key Points and my views on that #1 - 4K LED Panel: The quality of picture is very good. It is a VA panel and the color reproduction and the viewing angles are good. I was pretty much concerned how it will turn out, due to the viewing angle reviews of VA panel. Even though it is inferior than IPS displays, you wont feel that much issues in dat to day usage. 4K and even the 1080p videos were awesome in it. Definitely you will have issues with fast moving videos (eg: sports), where in you will experience few missing frames. MEMC feature is missing in the 50' version. You will have to opt for the 65' version for that case. Vivid mode will be loved by those who like their videos to be highly saturated. #2 - Design: WOW factor is missing from design point of view. It is not the slimmest of the TVs from Mi as well. It is just OK. #3 - PatchWall: The TV has PatchWall 2.0 which is an improvement considering the previous version. The content is fetched from multiple apps and if you have subscription to most of them then it will be easy to guide through rather than opening each of them separately. The Android TV interface is also present and we can easily switch to that with a dedicated button in the remote. #4 - Sensy TV: I would recommend you invest an additional Rs. 300 for the Mi IR cable as well. When you add the IR Cable to your TV & STB, you can browse your DTH channels using the TV remote. The set up procedure is available in YouTube. Once done it is really helpful. #5 - Sound: The speakers are the same 20W type and it is good enough for living room. If you are bass lover its good to invest in a sound bar. I have a soundbar with sub-woofer from Sony, and luckily it has Bluetooth option. The connectivity options are pretty limited in Mi TV, either your sound bar should support HDMI, SPDIF or Bluetooth. So please be careful if you buy a low cost soundbar. Analog audio out is missing. #6 - Apps: Prime video & Netflix is supported natively (dedicated buttons are also present in the remote) as well as Google Play store is present. In case any apps are missing in the Playstore you can always sideload it. #7 - Processor & Memory: Processor seems to be decent for now. The Memory is on the lower side compared to competitors. It should have been improved At 29,999 INR, and the loads of features, it’s a steal and everyone is rushing to grab one.","Its a real steal deal, great value for money",B07X841RGL
"Dear Guys, Hello.. Please find my review as hereunder after minutely observing almost a month. I believe that it will be really helpful for all of you. I have tried my level best to cover each point in this review. 1. Build quality is good. It is not metallic but quite impressive. No complain. 2. Picture quality is very good. In order to feel the real charm of watching TV, at least 720p is required. Full HD/4k looks great and stunning. 3. Speaker output is good. Do not expect high bass. But trust me it is good enough for a room (16x16 feet). 4. Remote control is very responsive but you need good speed of internet to work it smoothly. 5. Patchwall 1.0 version. No update till date. 6. User interface of TV is quite impressive and friendly. 7. There is no lag while operation of TV. 8. Google voice assistant works great. But you need good speed of internet. Commands identification is really awesome. 9. No need to use TATA/Airtel/any DTH service. Please use high speed of internet (highly recommended to use fiber) and take subscription of Sony Liv, Hotstar, amazon prime, netflix. You will really feel amazing and wonderful experience of watching TV. 10. There is no 3.5mm jack. 11. One Ethernet port is given. 12. Please use V guard stabilizer (as per your load) in order to avoid any PCB damage. 13. Do not press the TV panel. It will deteriorate the life of panel. Some reviewers said it is not fixed properly. But trust me this is not affecting picture quality or watching TV experience anyhow. 14. Minimum 7 feet distance is required for watching 720p or 1080p/i channels. 15. Viewing angle is not very great since it is VA panel. But it is in acceptable range. Do not worry for that. If you are satisfied with my review. Please like it. It will encourage me to review other products. Happy shopping. Best Regards..",Amazing TV For Such A Good Price,B07X841RGL
"I am writing this review after using for 1 week 1. Build quality Build quality looks good. Nice design, all accessible ports, simple LED indicator and power button in the bottom bezel, thinner bezels. But stand is light weight plastic, tv shakes for toch or movements. I feel its unstable and may fall I handled carelessly on table top. 2. Display let's kkt talk about type and tech of panel. Compared to many other TV in this range I feel this is best for price. Blacks are not deep and appear grey. HDR 10 is great, brightness is little low with lot of inhouse lighting/daylight but not a problem. 4K content shows amazing. 3. Audio Sound is decent, not much bass Very loud back firing speakers Dolby digital sound is noticeable in HD channels and HD content. You might need sound system or sound bar if you want more immersive experience 4. Android /Patchwall I liked patcwall more than android. It has bigger icons, all OTT content visible on home screen and doesn't require multiple apps or searching much. Easy to navigate and very smooth. All the Inputs are displayed so no need to goto setting to change AV inputs Like in android. Google assistant doesn't search on patcwall but only in android TV home. Some features I found worth mentioning Vivid picture mode will increase the picture quality and more colors I hope MI will bring more improvements in future Sound modes are useless I prefer custom adjustments It supported my 2TB hard disk without any lags and smooth navigation. In built Video player is useless, download VLC which has more features and plays all videos without lag. Bluetooth remote is boon easy to use fast and could use in any direction and from upto 6-7 metres as I tried. 4.5gb user available ROM is less I felt but can use a Pendrive also as inbuilt storage. No branding or symbol on TV bezels. It supports sensi remote with which we can use set top box and TV with same remote (should purchase separately) A very happy purchase during this Dasara, I recommend this TV to others.

"So before buying the MI 50 inch tv, I surveyed Panasonic, VU, LG, and Sony tv. I would say its picture quality is comparable to entry-level LG AI Thin q tv but with few backdrops that I would like to discuss here. First, let's talk about Cons: 1) The TV is not that bright. Lg entry-level tv (The one that costs 50k- 60K for 50 inches) is a little brighter than this tv maybe 10 percent brighter but LG nano cell tv 2019 (cost around1 lakhs for 55 inch) is easily 60- 70 percent brighter and having punchy colors. 2) Screen is reflective Like many cost-effective TVs, The screen is very reflective. Probably more than VU. You will see a tube light reflection on the screen during dark scenes. So that is quite annoying. 3) Youtube skips audio at 4K I am having a 100 Mbps speed connection but when I play Youtube at 4k it skips the sound. Possibly due to the small buffer size allocated to the Youtube app. Now, That might be solved by an update because I didn't face any issue playing UHD/4k Video on Netflix or Prime. 4) Picture settings You have to recalibrate the picture quality while playing HDR content because your standard picture setting would be too dark. So I have to manually shoot the brightness to 75 and backlight to 100 to enjoy the HDR content. Expensive TVs recalibrate themselves as per the content but here you have to do it yourself 5) Lack of 3.5 audio jack I guess everyone is already aware but I have just mentioned beause I am having a legacy music system. Now I guess you are aware of the pros but still: 1)Price: At 27,000 (after discount), you can barely complain about it. My friend bought a 49-inch sony tv for rs 85000 and Of course, Sony is quit bright with punchy colors but mi tv is 1/3rd the price. It is value for money. Further, in 2 -3 years Qled or 8K tv might become mainstream so you might want to save bucks for them. Apps: I can play all apps like Netflix, Prime Video, Sonyliv, Hotstar, VOOT, Jio cinema, PLEX. But apps like Amazon Music and chrome browser or any browser is not available to download from the play store. And I haven't tried sideloading them as of now. At this price, I am happy with the TV and you will be too. If you are a videophile with 1 lakh rs, go buy LG nano cell 55-inch latest model.",Don't buy before reading this,B07X841RGL

"Amazing product by MI The order was delivered withing a day of placing order. Installation was done at the same time as delivery (both persons came together), so there was zero down time between delivery and installation/demo. The picture quality is amazing. I have another 50 inch 4k smart shinco tv bought 6 months back at around the same price, but the picture quality is as different as night and day (MI has much better quality) Sound quality is pretty good. Voice is pretty clear and sound effects are good. There are sufficient connections available (hdmi, usb etc), but that is the same as what every brand is offering these days. Netflix, amazon prime and hotstar work perfectly. The remote is sleek and has a premium look (though it only features the essential buttons, a change from the usual remotes which have a button for everything) The only issue i have faced is that there is no direct way to reach usb/hard disk. You can open those using video players, but no way to directly choose the source. It is more of a interfsce issue, which might be corrected during future updates. Overall, i feel this is a great buy.

Great product !!!!,Best in class!!!,B07X841RGL
"Amazon service has been ridiculousright from installation to service you provided on my issue with tv. I asked to return the product and there was an inspection arranged the technician saw issue and said that this I can ask for a replacement but he submitted report to Amazon saying everything is good. Then I called customer service and they arranged second inspection but this time no technician showed up, I got calls from two different technicians and both asked on what the issue is, also the second person asked me to forward a video that I recorded on WhatsApp, at the end no one showed up. This the worst service across all e-commerce platforms I have experienced. I would not purchase anything expensive from Amazon going forward and will share my story with people in my network. Product is average. Issue with patchwall, no resolution provided even by Xiaomi. What they mention on website about 80% content being free is incorrect. Picture is not that great.",Worst customer service from Amazon,B07X841RGL
"Pros 1. Picture quality is very good. 2. Viewing angle is great 3. build quality is above average ( cannot expect more at this price) Cons ( would say MI need to improve the quality ) 1. remote is very sensitive, a little touch on the remote would switch app or increase volume 2. audio is just average, watching an action movie would be horrible. 3. There is no optical out or 3.5 mm jack . so, connecting the tv to audio system will be a pain. 4. Port positioning could have been better, once you wall mount then its very tough to reach the component and ethernet port. Biggest problem with the TV is , randomly the apps would crash (netflix, youtube and zee5) and you would get irritated once you fast forward or rewind on Prime Video,because after that complete audio and video would be out of sync and play pause wont work for the playback. @mi get the latest apk from prime video which would fix the audio video sync issue and play/pause issue",Great value for money but comes with few compromises,B07X841RGL
"This is my second mi tv,the previous one was the 55 inch tv 4 pro... This particular model uses a 10bit panel,which is a considerable improvement. Storage memory should have been 16gig atleast.2 gigs of ram is fine. Sound @20 watts speaker is ok,better to use a home theatre. Bluetooth connectivity is an added advantage.many budget brands lack this even today. Netflix and prime comes out of the box with dedicated buttons on remote Tv as such is very light due to its plastic body.bezels are sufficiently slim. The remote is something i dislike. very minimalistic and a measure to cut costs. It has google assistant and the voice assistant functionality works fine. Mi doest even provide the batteries. There is no dedicated mute button. Would prefer an additional air remote. No optical and 3.5 mm audio outputs. Hdmi arc saves the day in a few cases.not in mine though. Wall mount is chargeable @rs500 extra. It is not a flagship tv,but it does tick many boxes at this price point. In my personal opinion i feel mi as a brand is better than many other budget brands like kodak, thomson,tcl and others. So atleast after sales support shouldnt be a problem.",Good for the price with a few ommissions,B07X841RGL
"This review is based upon installation and screen quality experience , installation person is worst, never respond to call. Quality of screen seems not 4K-UHD. Mi installation service personally feel very bad. Mi only wants to make money in the name of wall mounting, after installation they even dont hand over installation report. Anyone can install tv no need to ask for installation as no proof is provided by installer, it's a kind of Mi honey trap.","No warranty void on self installtion, Mi is giving wrong info.",B07X841RGL
"I bought this for data saver option, which is not available in this now. Enquired MI expert who came for the demo. He is not aware about data saver.",Data saver option not available,B07X841RGL
TV is good. Good TV at this price. Picture quality is awesome. Sound is also good. There is no aux connection for audio. Wall mount is not included in package. It cost Rs. 500/- Amazon delivery was late. It scheduled 4th Oct but finally delivered on 11th Oct. Installation was done same day. I didn't expect such a fast response from MI installation person. Installation Guy is nice person. He done installation easily and explained everything about TV. Initial impression is satisfactory.,Value for money and Good TV,B07X841RGL
"Picture quality is tremendous... I have found one negative, there is no audio output options... Home theater or stereo can be connected through S/PDIF only.. and you have to purchase Audio Converter and audio cable to connect this... Audio converter need separate power also... I don't know what is the reason not including audio output option... I have purchased the audio converter but its not working properly sound quality not good.... So am requesting you all don't buy this #MK LED TV 4X those who have going to connect their stereo with audio cable ... OUTPUT AUDIO NOT AVAILABLE.....",AUDIO OUTPUT NOT AVAILABLE,B07X841RGL

"I am writing this review after a week's use. I purchased in the very first flash sale on 28th Sept. Got it delivered on 4th of Oct. The installation was superfast, the technician came within two hours. Now the actual review : 1. Picture : The panel is not as bright as Sony or as vivid as Samsung but hey it can give a tough competition to other 4K TVs especially because of its aggressive pricing or should i say ""honest pricing "". Anyways the 4K videos are a delight to watch on this tv. Though the brightness of the panel is on a lower side but that is not a deal breaker. Overall it delivers more than price. 2. Sound : Sound is fair enough for a big hall. Though it lacks the crispness and bass. But if you pair it with a good quality sound bar the sound is pretty nice. 3. OS: The TV runs on Android TV and on top of it MI's custom UI Patchwall. I preferred Patchwall more in this TV though in my earlier 4C Pro I preferred Stock Android. MI team has really worked hard to make Patchwall more user friendly. It is fluid and fast. Though I was really disappointed with the courier service, the TV is worth every penny you spend. So just go for it.",Superb Purchase... Worth Every Penny,B07X841RGL
"Display : 4/5 The pannel is bright and crisp. Although anyone using Set top box won't like the clarity much. I do recommend HD set top box for best clarity. Audio: 2/5 Sound isn't the best considering the competition. Connectivity : 3/5 Connectivity is alright. Although when you have your router past 70m, the TV struggles a bit. Value for money: 4/5 Considering the price, it's the best 4k pannel you can buy. The TV is capable of playing 4k content without much hussle. Blacks are good. I do recommend to sit a little away from the tv to get the best viewing experience. All in all a good product for the budget.",Honest opinion,B07X841RGL
Purchased the TV on first sale..delivery in 2 days same day installation - Awesome. Picture quality is Awesome mainly when stretching the low quality video to full size. TV is slow when opening apps and loading videos.some times apps are crashing. May be next version requires a better processor and more ram like their mobile section. Patch wall is not good as expected. need a options to permanently disable that and make android a default home.,Budget King but not Top performer,B07X841RGL
"This MI TV comes with lots of features , and 4K and HD content is very good and believe me 4k content from Netflix and amazone prime is Pvr like experience with this big tv. I am very happy with purchase .",MI 50 Inch 4K TV Awesome experience,B07X841RGL
"I bought MI 4X TV 4K 50inch. It's good experience. Everyone likes this TV in my home. I will add few pics here for your reference and my observations. 1) Cheap and best... If your budget is less than 40k or 50k, please go for this. Because what ever big brands available in market less than 50k, don't expect this all features as well as that was launched one or two year before may be... 2) I was done lots of market study, my budget was below 50k, I sorted big brands like sony, samsung and Lg brands but finnaly i understood this big brands selling their basic and older version in less than 50k. Picture Quality: It is more than my expectation in 30K. Attached pictures are proof. I played many 4K videos. As well Airtel HD channels and SD (standerd channels) also. I thought may SD channels won't get good clarity. But it's beyond my expectations. It's also looking good in this TV. Sound quality: Don't expect 5.1 or Dolby X.or Atmos here. Your will get better sound but voice clarity is less and sometimes need to increase volume . Remember this 4K 50inch in 30k. My suggestion go for one sound bar yamaha/ Polk. Value for money: 100%",My Review after 3rd week.,B07X841RGL
The product was delivered to me on time. The installation was scheduled the next day which happened without any hassle. The installation guy was very coperative and answered all my queries. The picture and sound quality of the tv is perfect for home use. There is no need for external speakers. I think a 50 inch 9.0 android tv at 30k price range is a definite go. Thank you Amazon.,A best TV in 30 k price range,B07X841RGL
Pros It's cheap It's large It's picture quality is good It supports Bluetooth headset 'speakers etc The remote is connected via Bluetooth so u do not have to point at the TV to use it u can even use it in the next room and it still works. We. Can load apps from usb Cons Remote shd have more buttons Sound quality is okay it can be better Air mouse is not provided You can even go for the 43 Inches one only available in flipkart.The 65 inches cannot be found That's all thanks for reading I think this may help you to chosse your TV,Excellent TV at this budget .,B07X841RGL

Its a nice product... Connect bluetooth devices.. UHD videos plays out perfectly ... Sound is somewhat disappointing at some places but overall a far better TV in this range... I was thinking to buy OnePlus TV but those were way out of the price range for a new TV..I observed one issue though sometimes videos and sound do not sync and lag 1 sec is it a problem or software issue ?,Great TV in the range..,B07X841RGL
"Perfect 4K TV at a perfect price. Whether it's 4K, Full HD, HD or SD everything looks attractive in this TV. Android 9 is perfectly working but some apps are bit slow.

I was sceptical about this product but took a chance and ordered this one. I got it around 28K in sale. Product got delivered befor estimated time and wall mount process done the next day. I must say MI service is fast and Amazon's delivery process also. It's a 50 inches 4k panel television which gives exact colour derails... Its a android TV so frequesnt security updated and most importantly it has built-in Amazon prime and Netflix. Though the sound output is not up to the mark but I connected this with my soundbar which gives me best output.,Best android TV,B07X841RGL

"I didn't expect it from Cloudtail India as a subsidiary of Amazon as I came to know. I got the Backlight Bleeding issue in the first one delivered well (with lot of concern and spend more effort in booking, delivery and installation). The guy came for the inspection confirmed it and requested for the replacement. After the same spend of effort and time, received the item and got installed. But, this time I got the defected item repaired one (refurbished) or defect in the manufacturing end. The screws in the backside of panel cover are tampered and the panel cover are not fitted well. I asked for the right product delivered for which I paid. But, they didn't optioned even after long fighting. Now, they have picked up the TV for the return and the refund is not yet initiated. No update in My Order link for the pickup completed too.",Backlight Bleeding Issue Is There! Damaged Items Delivered - Not Sure Its From Mi End or Seller End,B07X841RGL

Important thing there no option of data saver and company has mentioned in the details. For that you have to wait for update. Hope they provide data saver update soon.,Its like playing a gamble with Mi tv,B07X841RGL

I have used this tv for more than 10 days. Below are the pros and cons. Pros:- 1. Very good picture quality and upscalling. 2. I really liked the remote. 3. Good amount of applications available. 4. Patch wall interface is refreshing. Cons:- 1. Sound quality is not upto the mark. 2. Not good for gaming at all. i have a ps4 but the tv sometimes lags if we turn hdr on and play ps4 games and it the picture quality lacks crispiness and sharpness and looks dull. 3. Chromecast gets stuck at time.. If ur on a tight budget then u can go for this tv & trust me u won't regret it but if u can chip in an additional 10k then u should buy a samsung or lg budget 4k tv,A bargain with a few cons but overall it's worth it.,B07X841RGL

"This is a budget TV so I cannot complain much but by reading other reviews that the picture quality is so awesome let me tell you on apps like YouTube, Netflix or anything played via USB port the quality is best at its price but when you switch to set up box the quality of video really decreases( The operator I use is TATASKY) even the HD channels don't seem that good as it was on my old TV,trust me if you can extend your budget go for sony may be a smaller size TV as the price difference is very high. Trust me if you can go for Sony TV definitely go for it or else this TV is just OK to be honest at this price, I was expecting a lot from this TV but as I said earlier I cannot complain because of its price tag",Don't expect much high quality on this TV,B07X841RGL

Only 2 points where the product don't deliver is sound is too low and not so crisp, another drawback is that the remote is too basic you need at least a button for options menu or mute button.

"Know before you buy, there's a major software problem in the TV that keeps it from rendering true dolby audio, the dolby decoding library breaks on a Dolby input and the audio just mutes. Can be verified via any true dolby audio source ( viz. Windows 10 Netflix app connected via HDMI, Tata sky by making sure the audio is set to Dolby digital or Dolby digital Plus from user settings or any other). This might not sound as bad (no pun intended) but just gave me a nerve wrecking 3 hour unboxing experience which ended finally when i pulled the tv's logcat to see what was really happening which filled up the whole log with errors from the dolby library failing in buffer errors. Other than that the picture quality is great for the price, sound is also satisfactory and the build quality is also not that bad.",Dolby audio library broken in the TV's OS...

They have pathetic service for installation and even more poor customer service. We had ordered mi TV via their platform. Although we had set up for installation and received confirmation nobody turned up and the customer support did nothing but raise a query with their team asking us to wait for 24 hours for service engineer. Also we can't install it ourselves as the warranty would be void. No matter how the tv is their service spoils the whole experience and would not recommend this product to any one.,Poor customer service,B07X841RGL

"Though it is android TV comes with pre-installed PRIME VIDEO and other Video apps, Prime video and other apps are getting crashed. i have raised complaint to Amazon to troubleshoot the issue and their technician has reported that TV has issues without showing-up to my house . i've also contacted VU customer service, they said this model has issue. i really had bad experience with amazon service. the lesson i learnt is buy it from your local shops around you, instead of going through this hardship. Zero Star for their valuable service. i don't thing Amazon will post my review.",Beware of VU Ultra Android TV,B07XK9JSGY
"So, bought this TV during the recent Great Indian sale. 1) This TV is apt for viewing distance of 10-15 feet - Comes with the wall mount. 2) The picture quality and sound is actually good - Not attaching images as I am not good with photography. 3) Pre-installed apps are working fine (Netflix/Zee5/Hotstar/the usual runners). 4) Play store provides ample other options. What's not working: 1) So, this probably is a Amazon Prime issue. I am not sure (need to call Amazon) but my Prime is not working. Like the device is registering to my account however when I try to play the video - I get a msg to go to amazon.com/videohelp. Which really is not helping. I can cast via my phone though so I guess, it's not a complete dead end. 2) Phone mirroring works however lags by a few seconds. Overall, a must buy at the discounted price that I bought it - INR 18k. Final word, a big thank you to the installation team. Missed the first schedule (understandable during sale season) however, second run wasn't a Miss and the guy was good. No hassle and polite.",When a woman reviews,B07XK9JSGY

"Honest Review. *Price- I got this with exchange and card discounts at 12k.. Without exchange u can het this around 17k. *Display - I am a marvel fan, i like to watch super heroes movies and this TV is a treat. Good clarity, color reproduction. No complaints from my end on this.. Yes i have observed that when we see from side closely we see little negative images maybe because of big screen to believe me this won't be a problem as i never had.. We see movies from from not from completely edge side of tv right.. *Sound - Sound is decent don't expect to work like soundbar.. I had LG tv earlier and comparing that with this sound is 40% better louder and clear.. But if u wish to have home theatre experience get home theater.. *Processor- To be honest i dont have any technical info on this but yes i download 1080p HD BluRay Movies in HEVC (Highly compress) format. My LG TV never read this format but this TV play smoothly without any glitches.. I have also downloaded MX player (as this is android tv). *Casting- Yes this is where i removed one star.. Casting need Internet connection unlike other Mi smart tv which works directly without Internet. Was very difficult for me to cast mobile to TV, at the end i used my mobile hot-spot to do so. This can be resolved with firestick (i had this earliesr to make my normal LG TV smart) or any other smart casting device which normally cost 1k. If anyone knows how to cast offline in this TV pls let me know. *Connectivity - No problem here.. It has Bluetooth, wifi, 3.5 jack, HDMI Arc.... Refer my screenshot.. Conclusion : With this said i am happy with my android TV.. I get real Theater experience with big screen watching HD movies.. You would get many reviews here but believe me there is nothing in this TV which may make u regret buying it..",Budget Android TV,B07XK9JSGY
"Plain cheating by Vu - this TV does not support Prime Video and Netflix, although the apps come pre-loaded and the remote comes with dedicated buttons. Secondly, it's got an extremely slow processor. Even YouTube takes a lot of time to load. Lastly, it was a nightmare to return this TV. I must have spent several hours over one week with Amazon customer care, to finally get the return approved. Both Prime Video Customer Care as well as the Vu company's technicians told me that this TV wouldn't run Prime Video and Netflix. It's shocking that Vu is so blatantly misleading their online customers; equally shocking is the fact that Amazon is also not doing anything about it.",Avoid! Don't get carried away by the ad,B07XK9JSGY

"Well for starters the complete playstore is not available. I could not even find Google Chrome but yes the picture quality is excellent and the sound too has become quite good since my first Vu TV. Overall a very good buy. So what exactly did I do for it to work. Firstly stop all updates. Not even system update cause the screen just stays put and nothing gets installed. Next step was to start installing desirable apps & to me the first I needed was a file explorer & a browser I found in playstore by searching just those words. Once that was done I did a system update. Now I can run any App bit Prime Video. When I try to log in it says can't login register on Prime ideo/MyTV. When I give the hashkey provided it says registration successful but on seeing devices registered this TV won't be found. So basically a dead end. Casting is slow but you need to only cast prime video else everything else can be side loaded. That is search for the app on your phone and install it via USB using file explorer. Yes Thope TV, Oreo TV, Typhoon TV, etc will work seamlessly. So basically it is not so simple but once you do everything falls in place. Would I recommend it? Damn well I will for at this price you get an excellent screen, sound again is very good & almost any Android App can be installed. No not Jio TV. I can see only half the screen! Update... Well when folks from VuTv called for feedback I did tell them about the Amazon Prime issue. The caller noted it down and sent me a PDF file containing the solution. It was upgrading OS to a Sep release & doing a reset. Now I had installed Apps & was wary of doing a reset. Now they called again to check if I had done the update or needed help. I said I hadn't done but they said everything would be fine. So I did a reset and was able to login to Amazon Prime & it worked. Also the sluggishness of casting got solved. So I am upgrading the rating to 5 stars from 4...",Thumbs up!! Upgrading to 5 stats,B07XK9JSGY

"Avoid buying from amazon Vu 43"" ultra android tv is a good buy at 21k and value for money, the picture quality and sound quality are good at this price. Also it comes with stock Android 9. The only issue which I have faced is prime video not working properly (which resolved through an update by proactive support from vu customer care) though has separate option in remote and mentioned in offering. It also sometimes responds a bit slow to remote actions. Unless you are ok with spending hours explaining issues to Amazon customer care executives one after another don't buy it from amazon, supposedly there is a large appliance customer care team which, as per my experience, is pathetic. Sharing the issues I have faced so that you are well aware of challenges when you buy any large appliance from Amazon: Installation: The installation guy has not come at the scheduled slot with no information. I was supposed to keep waiting for him. Once the waiting time (1.5 hours) is over I had to spend 3 hours explaining the issue to Amazon customer care, with no resolution. Supposedly there are different teams and call will get transferred to different executives and keep waiting on music (you would be asked to receive a call back from chat executive) and explaining the issue again and again. Finally, they told me they are unable to help. Installation guy came to my place 10 days after the tv delivery. Warranty: Though there was free extended warranty from acko as per the offer when I bought the tv. I have not recieved any information regarding the same. I had contacted Amazon customer care regarding the same and again faced the same pattern. After spending one hour ten mins explaining the issue to different executives I was asked to call again after few hours. Knowing the final response and the hastle I have to go though with Amazon large appliance customer care, I have decided to forget about the extended warranty. I believe a good number of frustrated customers may not follow up for warranty.",Vu ultra Android TV is good but don't buy from amazon,B07XK9JSGY

"For all those whose in built Ch'cast isn't working just change country from USA to India. About the tv. At third of a price compared to known brands with similar features, you simply get what you pay for. Absence of a voice remote irks but considering the performance of the Google app you might as well not have it. Picture is blindingly super bright. I have no idea why the emphasis on bright by all brands. You aren't going to use this in sunlight ... Duh On the brighter side (no pun there lol) the colours produced are very accurate. A piece of advice. Don't judge it by the dth performance. Judge it by playing some good online content. Colours are generally warm and well, getting adjusted from a pana tv the motion seems jerky to me. Sound is loud enough but at times the speakers can't handle the bass and distortion is more than evident. OS is stock android. And well, stock Android always works best, in my opinion that is. Looks... Really nice. It looks really nice, for the price , yes pretty much. Quality...

"Amazon and installation team did a good job in delivering(10th) and installing the TV as per schedule on 11-10-2019.Thanks. Coming to performance of the tv, it coonected well with WiFi. Not yet tried other smart TV features The picture quality is not good for a FHD TV. Color reproduction is not good with pink skin tone, smudged picture, no sharp pictures. Quite surprised to note that It is like a early vintage CRT TV. Not able to identify distant objects in the screen. Sound is good with stereo and surround sound working well. But, loud annoying sound alerts while scrolling down any menu items in picture modes, sound styles and other settings is a cause of concern. It's only one day after delivery. Watch for 2/3 days and if the performance of the tv doesn't improve, think of returning for exchange. Now after checking it's is found that it's resolution is not 1920X1080. It's only 1280X720p.

"(2days usage)TV as such has everything working out of the box. Android smart it is ! with good audio (not excellent) and video quality .All streaming services app,playstore etc work as expected once you connect to internet and logins provided . Can't side load apps (i didn't find options yet ) . At this price range what you expect ;). *The biggest spoiler for VU is that Amazon handles the install services very poorly ,it took a week to get this installed (since DIY install void warranty) .At first it was Amazon app giving error to book slots,afterthat It takes 48+hrs fot site visit.*",Value for money but poor Amazon install service,B07XK9JSGY
"Primevideo app started working only after a software upgrade by VU engineer. Netflix, youtube and hotstar are ok. Zee5 was also not working even after upgrade. After a day, update from google play store made the app work. Kodi also pre installed is still not working. Sunnxt installed from google play is ok. Hungama preinstalled is ok.",VU32GA apps performance,B07XK9JSGY

"TV is exceptionally good. The picture clarity is excellent. I have one issue though, and that is if sound. The spoken voices in movies are very less audible and the background music is almost twice loud at same volume. If i want to hear the dialogues properly, then the music score blasts through the TV. Can someone help me with this ? Tried almost all settings. Will give 5 star if problem is solved.",VU TV Review,B07XK9JSGY
"Pro 1.Sound volume is good but quality is not. 2.Ease of Connectivity is good. 3. Picture Brightness and Contrast are good when viewed right from front (90deg) 4. Composite ports and USB ports responding well but USB 1 is not recognised. Cons 1. Disappointing point is the picture quality when vied from an angle.Against claims of 178deg viewing angle, the quality goes on deteriorating as the angle increases and at 178deg it is bad. 2.The operating Manual is too concise. Just passing mention about Chromecast, Bluetooth etc and if one is not already some sort of an expert, it will be difficult. Overall Fair quality. Value for money.",Overall good,B07XK9JSGY
"This review is edited after about a week of use. Good picture quality, decent sound quality. Best of all, excellent value for money esp with the exchange of my old TV. Earlier, I had Netflix, YouTube working fine but I had mentioned that Amazon Prime I wasn't able to sign in, due to some bug. I got an email from Vu detailing the procedure to ensure that Amazon Prime also works. I had to reset to default settings, but after that Amazon Prime has also started working. So all is fine now The delivery was on time, but the installation was delayed by about a week and took several follow ups. But was finally done well.",Very good,B07XK9JSGY
Good picture quality & fast installation,Wealth of mony,B07XK9JSGY
"The TV is competitively priced with attention to detail in design. An example is during the installation, I noticed that they have taken good care that in a case of wall mount, the mount does not damage the wall & hence some cushion has been provided along. The only which could be improved is the speed. I felt the TV was a bit slower as compared to my other TV although this does not affect the viewing experience & Hotstar takes a long time to load. I am not sure if this is specific to my TV but nothing major as well. Overall a good product in affordable price. I had issues with the installation from Amazon & after escalation, VU themselves made sure the TV is installed on time & checked with me if I am satisfied with the service. That is a really great after sales experience not so common across other brands I use. The person from VU who did the installation was also extremely good & had a good understanding with the installation. The Picture & sound quality is no doubt good for the price. Overall a very pleasant experience so far.",A TV worth the money,B07XK9JSGY
"The amazon prime issue is solved by doing a factory reset of the tv. This Tv has decent build quality, picture quality and most of the features you would require factoring in the price you pay. However, what bothers me the most is the poor sound quality. It distorts with a jarring effect whenever there is any sound with bass in it, for example background music, loud noises etc. This happens not only on high volume but on low volume as well as well. The sound comes off as boxy and annoying. Have tried different sound setting as well but can't seem to resolve the issue. Not sure if this problem is being faced by everyone or for my tv alone hence am going to ask for a replacement. Update 1: The Technician that Amazon sent to check the TV has now confirmed that there is a functional problem with the sound of the TV and it needs to be replaced. However, after many phone calls with Amazon customer care they are now telling me that the option to replace the TV is not appearing in their backend system and there is only an option for initiating a refund. However, a refund is not the solution for me as the price for the same model has now gone up by 1500/- on Amazon (from the same seller, Cloudtail), so I can't repurchase the same model at the price I paid. All this while they were assuring me that the TV would be replaced if a fault was found but are now saying that they can only refund the amount paid as the TV is not in stock with the vendor. This is not true as it is still available on the Amazon site through the same vendor albeit at a higher price i.e. 19999/- (instead of 18499/-, which is the amount I paid for it). Since all of this is no fault of mine I do hope they are able to resolve this issue amicably without further delay Update 2: Finally received a replacement for the TV a few days back. But was suspicious as it did not come in the type of packaging as the first TV I received (no protective plastic covering on the outside of the box). Once the technician opened the box to install the same we found out it was a used TV as there was no protective plastic covering the TV inside the box as well, the TV was just placed inside the box with the accessories. The remote batteries were already inside the remote and once the TV was switched on it went directly to the viewing screen without going through any setup. Add to all this the sound issue persisted in this TV as well so had no option but to return the same for a refund. Please be aware that Amazon is recirculating these TVs and hence their customers must make sure that they are infact receiving a new/unused piece. This has been one of the few times I've had a bad experience with Amazon but hopefully they look into the matter.",Very poor sound quality and used TV given as replacement,B07XK9JSGY
Totally satisfied with the product and service. Will recommend it.,Totally Satisfied with the product,B07XK9JSGY
"The product is very good ... delivery was prompt by Amazon as usual !! The picture quality as well as sound quality is pretty good for the price and the Smart TV features work well !! The latest Android pie as the OS delivered a smooth experience, the TV remote is responsive and having direct buttons for Netflix, Prime Video, YouTube, Hotstar as well as Google Play helps immensely. Bluetooth connectivity is a boon for connecting wireless headphones etc, Casting your phone works pretty well ... etc. etc. Lot of good features that I found useful. I did compare many similar TV's before buying this one, and am not at all disappointed with my decision till date. I would have loved to have 3 HDMI connections, but that is only a minor miss I would say. This is not my main TV (that is a bigger and high-end TV) so I am not comparing the two, I have a fair understanding and appreciation of AV, hence in my judgement this is a very good TV at this price point (maybe better than some products at a little higher price points than this. I would recommend !!",Very good quality and feature rich TV for the price !,B07XK9JSGY

"The whole experience with the TV is really good. Amazing picture clarity and sound output is commendable. All the apps works perfectly except Prime Video which is a bummer. Amazon says that the TV is not supported. Not sure why they advertise that it support Prime Video. VFM product if you don't mind the issue with Prime Video. *****Edit***** Changing my rating to 5 Stars. Prashanth from VU called me up and said that the issue should be fixed by updating the software to the latest version. I updated to the latest one (Sept 16th release). It still didn't work. Prashanth asked me to factory reset once. After doing a factory reset, Prime Video started working. Happy with the service and happy with the product. :)",Amazon Prime Video doesn't work. *Edit* It worked after a factory reset,B07XK9JSGY
"When I purchased it, I was facing trouble in casting tv with my phone, and zee5 was not working properly, But both problems resolved with first software update. + video quality is good, the sound is loud and clear. UI is good. The problems I can see now is: Half star lost here. 1. The missing feature is: no mic/ voice button on remote + voice feature does not work, you can only type key by key using remote which is very hectic thing, when you could just speak and get things types on screen. Below mentioned 2 points are negligible and can be ignored or might be fixed in upcoming releases. 2. amazon prime not working, but this is working in the Casting feature. 3. sound is a little distorted when we surf/move between apps, only that sound is distorted, tv sound is awesome. Build quality- half star lost here. 4. The screen is not 100% fit and taped on corner boundary, I can see light coming out at some places standing parellet to screen, this point I am not considering since we have paid half the price of LG/ Samsung haha. I got this 40-inch device in 18500, 1000 amazon pay cashback I got and 1850 I will get in SBI bank account cashback, So I got it for 15650 :) + plus point is, got both stands with TV, MItv does not wall mount stand, so save of 400 Rs again. + got Acko 1 year extra warranty from Amazon because of Big festival Sale. Earlier I was confused because of a few above points, but casting resolved half of my doubts :) You can buy it without much doubt.",only voice button mic feature is missing in remote,B07XK9JSGY

"Brought Vu premium and Vu UltraAndroid for myself and relatives so here's my short summary. Before getting into the positive I just want to point out the one con i found so far which is the lack fo 3.o Usb ports for the TV it comes with 2 USB 2.0 ports only. Now, Let's get into the picture quality ,the picture quality is really good with good brightness level and contrast. FHD channels looks pretty good too. i don't think you can beat this TV's picture quallity compared to other TVs on a budget, First thing you notice is how well it upscales Videos that are non FHD to look miles better. Espcially when there are still alot of Tv channels in SD,this upscaling feature alone makes the tv worthy along with picture quality. In terms of Android experience it's pretty much Stock android Pie tv experience with occasional lags here and there even high end Android TV's have this issue so not much to complain here. Tv comes with Netflix Amazon prime youtube and hotstar installed with first 3apps getting their own dedicated buttons on the remote . The picture quality through streaming is pretty good too. Coming to the sound quality i found it better then my mi soundbar and prefered to use inbuilt tv speaker.It's got good bass ,clarity and quite loud . Conclusion If you are looking mainly for the picture quality on a budget you should be better going of with this or the non Android VU Ultra Tv for 16k. IF you don't mind spending an extra few thousands you should consider getting the VU premium android 4k not that there are lot of 4k content, but even the FHD channels looks so much better in that tv its more vivid and black levels are deep. Streamed 4k videos though Youtube to my Vu premium the picture quality is great and got great details to it. For full detailed review i found Techiebeez india channel to have good review of this TV.",Probably the Best in-terms of Picture quality for Budget,B07XK9JSGY

"As a TV, it is a good buy. The picture and sound is good. TV design is good but its the software that is a let down. the resolution of home screen etc is a let down. Its not sharp at all. Netflix is working but we are unable to use AMAZON prime ( it is a built in app ). Its much better to buy VU Non Smart tv and purchase a Fire Stick or equi. While that was by earlier review. VU sorted out the problem almost immediately and they definitely deserve a mention and a pat on the back. Seems like my SMART TV is SMART once again. We are more than satisfied with the software now that all our grievance have to looked into. I would not only recommend the tv for the display and sound, but also VU as a brand that is Prompt in AFTER SALES.","Be Smart, Dont buy SMART... unless its a VU.",B07XK9JSGY
"This is my 3rd VU tv have moved to VU from brands like Sony and LG and this brand has never disappointed me. Best part is the picture quality, colours are very vivid. On comparing to my cousin's MI tv I found the picture quality to be far better.

"It is not a matured android tv. Problems:- 1) Unable to do initial configurations with mobile,it simply does not connect to it so need to enter app login credentials through on screen key board which is cumbersome to do with tv remote. 2) Every time there is a new firmware update it simply gets reset so now you need to start initial configs again. Do hotstar,amazone prime,google, Zee4 .... and several other app registration again and yeah you need to download them again. 3) remote does not have voice recognition. 4) Bottom clamp stands are wide and slightly bent outwards so u need a sufficiently bigger table if using table mount. 4) When using screen cast it lags in display, so when you swipe to next picture on your phone it will display the next pic on tv screen after about 5 seconds. Forget about HD videos. Okok:- Screen and colour quality is acceptable at this cost. Sound is also normal.",Not a matured android TV.,B07XK9JSGY
"i ordered the tv on 29th sep 2019 and received on 5th oct and installed on 6th oct. the installation guy installed the tv and shown me some operations. after that i started using the tv . i purchased this tv because this tv directly support prime video and hotstar and hot keys given on remote it self. i tried to open hotstar but failed . after lot of brain storming i decided to download the app and i did the same it gave me a code to verify i followed the procedure and enjoying it. no problems the same thing happened with zee 5 alsso now the real story starts now i am not able to open prime video. it is asking me sign in , i did the same and it gave me a code and with that code i registered my tv. then it allowed me browse the content. when i am opening some movie it is not at all opening and saying about some error and suggesting contact prime video help. but i could not get any help from that. finally i thought if i update the software i may find some solution. it 1 hour for me how to update it. finally i updated it and i am able to watch from prime video. but very very frustating point is if you switch off the tv and again you have to re login and verify your tv . this is very very frustating to me so far i made near about 15 login it is not happening with any other app, why it is happening with prime video . i hope vu and amazon prime video will resolve this problem at the earliest. here i am attaching 5 photos regarding how to update. finally i am giving only four stars and cutting one star with respect to prime video app. let me check the remaining apps after that i will come back",a good tv with annoying prime video app,B07XK9JSGY

But I am not able to open the app. I am getting the error, unable to process the request, please try again later. Also I am not able to do casting also from jio cinema app from my mobile.

Secondly I've gone through all negative reviews and compared it with my TV, unfortunately none of them are valid, Prime is perfectly registered and we finished watching 2 full movie as well.

Firstly it was delivered well on time and When I opened the package, I was impressed with the looks. Installation itself is damn easy and I mounted it on the wall. Picture quality, sound quality is awesome and ease of configuring the set with your mobile and broadband is extremely user friendly. The remote has user-friendly keys for direct access to Amazon prime, Netflix, hotstar, YouTube and Google Play. It can be connected by HDMI, USB , cables and even with the phones using MIRACAST. The response to Internet is crisp and overall it's a value for money.

"**This is a genuine review posted by a genuine Customer** Placing Order: I have placed the order during the great Indian festival and got a discount on the original price. I have purchased this TV for 21000. I have also opted out for Acko Insurance. Delivery: I live in a city which is connected by railways and transport very well with the major cities like Hyderabad and Banglore. As the seller cloudtail shipped my product from Greater thane I was pretty sure that I will get delivery within 3 days. But that did not happen. Due to the ongoing sale and Diwali holidays, I have received the product after 8 days.Amazon delivered the product within the deadline. First Impression: After the delivery, I have unboxed the TV and put it on the stand given in the box. The setup of the tv is not that difficult as it is an Android TV. After the whole setup, I quickly jumped to the video quality Video: Video quality is better than LG and close to Samsung. Brightness is slightly high but it won't bother you if you are not going to stick to the premium led panels expectations. Audio: Audio quality has impressed me. It is better than the premium rivals. The 20W output is good enough for 10 feet distance. Speed: As it is an android tv, it comes with inbuilt RAM and storage. The 1 GB ram will keep you wait for 30 seconds when you press on from your remote. After 30 seconds the home screen appears. Once you get started there is no such delay in operations. Interface: Interface is stock android and customizable. Connectivity: Wifi, Bluetooth and USB ports works very well Remote: You can handle the majority of tasks using remote and remote has soft textured keys. Installation: For the installation, I had to call VU customer care to place an installation request. The installation guy came after 1day. He was skilled enough to mount the TV properly. I have found VU customer care good enough till now. Overall Comment: I personally think that as my budget was within 25000 rupees and I wanted a tv with youtube and Full HD capabilities, this one is a good choice and my family doesn't watch the TV whole day. It's a good tv and I suggest this tv if you have a budget within 25000 but don't expect too much like sony or any premium brand as you are buying a product considering the price point. I found this TV fulfilling all my needs. I have chosen this TV over price and I am very satisfied with my choice. I didn't want to purchase a TV worth 44K just to watch for 1 hour. Overall I will rate this TV 4 stars. If brightness is adjusted and some more RAM is given then I would have might give it 5 stars.",I Am Satisfied With My Choice,B07XK9JSGY

I bought this television as it's features were awesome but when the tv arrived and i started using it i started noticing defects. 1. When we increase volume the audio started to distort when ever watching movie background music and sound started to mix and can't able to hear that sound. 2. Front pannel is not well placed in it. It's cause of the company cheap quality of plastic that they have used in television the front bezels are coming off due to which the light leaks this is with all vu televisions as i replaced it with another and found same defect in it . I have atached pictures of that . Think once before buying this television.,Worst company to in terms of quality,B07XK9JSGY
After sale service is very poor. I received product on 17th October 2019. Received mail regarding installation on 2nd Nov 2019. Now I received mail that my installation date is not confirmed. They also did not tell when they are going to install tv,After sale service is very poor.,B07XK9JSGY
"I am quite happy with my purchase of Vu 40GA. The picture quality of this tv is very good with wonderful rendition of HD content. The sound quality though depends a great deal on the source. Bluetooth connectivity, playback from USB drives, casting from smart phone all work well. Even composite input from an old DVD player via an old A/V cable gets reproduced without any hitch. The only thing lacking is mic support on the remote for Google Assistant. Had it been present, it would have been a perfect addition to the hotkeys for Netflix, Prime Video, YouTube and Google Play on the remote.",Excellent affordable smart Android TV,B07XK9JSGY
This product is well Demo has given proper way I am satisfied .,"Instalation is very well ,Demo has given properly",B07XK9JSGY
"I bought this tv this September for 9.2k. After 10days of use I'm reviewing this product. Pros : 1. Dedicated buttons for Amazon Prime, Netflix, YouTube,Hotstar. 2. Picture Quality is good. 3. Sound quality is awesome. 4. U will get wall mount with tv. 5. Connects with WiFi easily. 6. Build quality is good. 7. Android 9 pie version. Cons : 1. No Google assistance. 2. Every time u have to login to Amazon prime when u turn on Ur tv. Which is irritating. No remember me option. For this range I don't think u will get better TV. So my advice go for it.",Very good TV with awesome sound quality.,B07XK9JSGY
"Initially i was hesitant to buy VU brand. But this is for my parents , the were using old CRT TV.so wanted to upgrade it. Confusion between vu,MI,micromax,tcl and Santo. But many social media ppl replied with VU tv with half mind. Even i got offer for LV TV around 13k. But already i had LG TV, it was having diplay issue. Every 2 years, inside led plastics fell off. And spent 5000 every two years. So i don't want to go for LG brand. And ordered this vu android latest TV. Since it's new to the market, I didn't get many reviews. With half minded i ordered. Tv reached earlier than expected (remote village in Tamilnadu).. But installation didn't happen at scheduled time. 4 days later. So i saw my TV installed 2 days back only. Its not HD but HD Ready. But quality of video is perfect HD for 32 inches. Played Netflix and YouTube videos seamlessly... Many ppl reviewed other VU branda having low volume...no... Its sound volume is more than expected. For my family its enough. Dolby effect also gud . ( if u need more effect pls go for home theatre) Netflix, hotstar and YouTube with remote buttons, we can get easily. ( in hotstar i couldn't able to select subtitles) I reduced one star because, amazon prime button in remote. But its having login issues. Even though we registered out TV in amazon page, I can't run amazon prime in this TV. But its having Inbuilt Chromecast. So u can cast all from ur mobile to TV. Now i can't tell abt durability, but its worth for every penny... I think VU is cheap and best. Simply go for it ❤❤❤❤",Good and budget TV. Must buy if u need good issue logfing smart TV,B07XK9JSGY
"Absolutely brilliant! I was little skeptical about buying it since it was offering so much for so little. Its a 32 inch smart tv which offers great colours and contrast and surprisingly the white balance offered is good at this price. Sound quality is fine though not great. Smart TV features are working smoothly (youtube, Amazon prime, sonyliv ) i had no issues while launching applications or while streaming them infact i can compare it with my firestick which i have for my other room. It also has a blutooth receiver as well The build quality is more than acceptable. It doesn't feel clumsy at all, the provided Remote is also sturdy and its buttons are responsive. The only thing which is at the downside is the OSD menu which could have been better in terms of screen positioning and the user interface ... Anybody who wants to buy a smart tv should not think twice ..just go for it ! Its a steal at the current discounts and offers ..",Simply Awesome,B07XK9JSGY
"I am glad that i choosed this one over other brands and even bigger brands. Pros: Seamless internet connectivity Easy interface Awesome colors whether SD or HD Shortcuts app buttons on remote All app woking well. Amazon app had an issue, however updating android feom app and resetting the tv resolved this. Working with out any lag now. Played games in 32 inches version and compeltely a good experience. Pairing easy with blutooth devices. Jio cimema supported. Cons: Volumen is loud, but 100% clear. This does not mean it will impact voice, buy this without any hesitation. No blutooth remote which is necceessary now a days. Its not there i guess in any of the size i guess but not sure. ChromeCast does not work very well. Lag on the screen, i can say its not usable in this kind of lag Not much content available.",This Tv beats big brands!,B07XK9JSGY
"OK this is an update. The sound stopped working after 5 days but has since come back. Don't know why. Amazon not helpful on the matter in any case. The menu is slow but it's a good picture, and sound (when it works). Easy to set up. Just play and play. Very light in weight. Only gripe is when Sky box is on, the volume control on the sky isn't working. Only TV volume works. Voice recognition doesn't work at all.",It's OK.,B07XK9JSGY

All apps functioning/working very fine. Must buy option in this segment.",Best Buy.,B07XK9JSGY
Just got the TV installed after a long wait(with VU dealer) . Picture quality is good. Sound quality is okay. Recommended to keep in standard mode if you don't have a external sound system. One last suggestion is DON'T DEPEND ON THE AMAZON SERVICE GUYS TO ASSIST FOR INSTALLATION.. THEY CHEAT YOU. After so much follow and Email exchange... We had to finally call the customer service of VU and get it INSTALLED FROM THE AUTHORIZED VU DEALER........ Happy with Product. Special Thanks to the VU service guy Mahesh Sharma for his assistance.,Good Product value for money..,B07XK9JSGY

Netflix, Prime video, hotstar, youtube among others. Users have been facing issue with accessing primevideo, but the latest Ota update solves the problem. Just update and do a factory reset. Viola it works! The sound is decent as well. You can pair bluetooth headset as well. The inbuilt speakers are also decent for a small room. Over all a quality tv for the price.

Pros Android Tv at affordable cost. Super from VU tv. Cons: No Remote Voice Assistant. Edit: VU customer service is awesome. They did everything to ensure my tv experience is good. They earned a loyal customer today. Amazon Prime works after recent OTA update. Updating my review from 2 to 5 after all what VU team did to ensure my satisfaction.,Best Android TV after OTA update patch,B07XK9JSGY

Leaving this review after a week of use. Good tv ...connectivity is good ... buitin Chromecast is good ... No issues in connectivity. Sound is good. Differnet modes for different types of modes. Buit in apps work fine though Amazon Prime gets disconnected sometimes however i can always chromecast it from phone so no worries there. All in all a good TV and i am very happy with the performance so far,Amazing Smart TV at Amazing price,B07XK9JSGY
"I bought this after comparing it with many other branded TVs such as Samsung, Xiaomi, LG, Motorola, etc. But finally decided to buy this because it's an Indian brand and the features and quality it offers are comparable to those Big brands as Samsung and LG and can easily beat Chinese made TVs in terms of display and sound quality & clarity. I recommend this TV to all those who are in a tight budget but want a really good picture quality and sound in a TV that too from an Indian Brand. Also latest Android 9.0, Bluetooth 5.0 and Chromcast works very well. The interface is easy to operate. Also, you get five shortcut keys for each streaming media (Hotstar, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Youtube) in remote itself, so no hassle. I faced no connectivity issues so far. As far as voice control is concerned, one can use their smartphones to operate their tv via Google Assistance, you just need to download the Google assistance app and apply settings to it.",Best Offering from an Indian Brand.,B07XK9JSGY
Product is good but installation and costumes care is worst. Not see the performance of the TV yet so cant say about performance of the TV,Worst costomer care and installation of VU,B07XK9JSGY
"40"" Bought in 16010/- (with icici discount). Amazon allow to check product with ""free open box verification"" which is really helful. Nice picture clarity, good contrast ratio, there is li'l bit vibrating voice/music on high volume, 1080i videos plays smoothly. But wait.... there is lot of hectic for installation. My TV has been installed after 19 days from the product delivery. after 1 time service man refuse to came due to traffic and 2 times VECARE (amazon's vendor) appoint the service man which was not belongs to my area. VECARE is the worst service i have ever experieced in my life.

"I got the 40 inch Vu Smart android TV and it is just awesome at this price. I bought it in amazon sale. Initially all the apps(Netflix, Youtube, Hotstar, Zee5) were working fine expect prime video which was disappointing but the installation guy installed some update of 840 MB, reset the TV settings and then all apps were working smoothly. The clarity is amazing and is visible clearly from any angle. Though I was not impressed with the sound but that can be ignored as most of the TV's do not have awesome sound. I have compensated that with JBL soundbar and now its superb experience for me. For this price range this Vu TV fulfills all the criteria and if you want are planning to buy go for this.",Very nice for this price range.,B07XK9JSGY
"It's been 10 days and so far my experience with VU Ultra Android range has been phenomenal. The picture quality is really vibrant and vivid. The colours are perfect in this range. The display is far better than it's competitors and also the colours seem pretty natural. Coming to the sound section, the 20W surround sound Dolby system is absolutely mind blowing. The voice is clear and the music just mellows your ears. The bass and everything is pretty good and at this price point everything works phenomenal. Netflix works perfectly. Every other Android supported application runs the same. The Chromecast feature also works flawlessly. The only issue I have faced is with Amazon Prime video. The TV supports the app. But the app has not been registered with Vu TVs till now. So registering of the device doesn't work. So using amazon video works currently with Chromecast feature only. Apart from this everything is perfect.",Best Smart TV under 20k,B07XK9JSGY

"The product is as per our desire. It comes with all the advance features at affordable price. VU issues - None of the installation person turned up despite multiple dates offered and followup. Too bad service, complete dissatisfaction. Only Problem area : 1) Wifi link disables multiple times. Then we need to struggle going in setting 2) QWERT Keyboard remote to be shared. It takes long time to type 3) Sound quality is ok, since we have Sony 5.1 channel we enjoy the sound effects. Gives you a theatre feel",Quality product at affordable price,B07XK9JSGY
"Overall happy with the product. It is very less in price compare to other products with same features in market. Overall a good deal. Only thing that I feel missing is voice recognization in remote.

"The installer came and gave a quick demo but was not equipped to activate the voice recognition feature. Hence I have given a blank rating on that. The screen cast / mirroring experience is pathetic. The audio is immediately casted from my Android phone to the TV, but the pictures follow after a delay of over 20 secs. I have absolutely no delay when I use a Chromecast device cast fitted on a normal (non-Smart) Sanyo TV over the same wi-fi network. The users manual is also below expectation. It does not even mention the exact model of the TV set purchased. So I am left wondering whether they made a packing mistake or just don't care about perfection.","Promised a world class experience, but fell short",B07XK9JSGY
"Nice TV with Android 9 out of the box.Netflix,Hot star & YouTube are working fine, however struggling with Amazon prime... Able To cast however the inbuilt app doesn't work. Awesome Display with good brightness and clarity. Placed as second TV in bedroom and it has very nice stereo speakers with awesome sound and watching movies was fun with clear dialogues. First VU TV and its very impressive. As Usual amazon is the best when it comes to delivery and products. Box contains wall mount as well as stand. The Display panel is what impress me the most. The panel used is definately of high grade with awesome clarity. Let's see how VU perform in long run.",Great,B07XK9JSGY
"Highly Disappointed with installation service after 16 days they called for same. I rejected and installed by own. Remote does not support voice feature, could be better.

This is the best deal you can get from an Indian market at your budget. It's to have a 43 inch TV at this affordable price. One thing I am still worried about is that I am unable to screen share/connect my iPhone to Vu TV. It would be great if the manufacturer shares any docs to do the same. The rest all is great with them. Thanks!,Best deal for Android Indian TV,B07XK9JSGY

My review Pros. 1.Good picture quality.Brightness is also satisfactory. 2.Latest android. 3.All the apps you need are working including prime video and netflix. Cons. 1.No voice search in remote. 2.Screen mirroring is jittery. 3.Sometimes apps crash in the middle especially youtube. 4.No bluetooth remote. Overall an excellent buy for the budget.Installation was also done on time.,Good picture quality for the price paid,B07XK9JSGY
Tv is awesome and it works fine. Though there are some lapse in installtation as the installation person is in hurry and went without proper installation. As a result amazon prime wasnt working.. I had to do factory reset and install TV all my own and install everything and the TV works fine now. All pre installed apps are working fine.. They should have given a microphone with the remote it's cumbersome to type all the time.,TV is great but can be improved (service installation and adding microphone in the remote),B07XK9JSGY
Yesterday bought this product. HD TV with Android 9 .good picture .sound features like dts and Dolby really appealing. seamless YouTube and prime video play .

"When VU launched in India with LCD screen, i was impressed by there picture quality during that time. My First LCD was from VU which didn't gave issue for good 7 Years. After that it started giving LCD panel issue and went blank. Since Technologies changed LED gave better quality i thought to go for the VU LED TV. These was the second from VU, which i bought 2 years back. Today as i Write this second VU product gave the same issue, LED Panel display has gone blank. When the VU technician visit to check the issue, the option given is to replace the Display Panel. Which cost equivalent to new one. Also they have scripted answer, with Humidity /moisture this are common issues. I read some of the blogs this is one of the common issue reported by other user. With 2 experience by now the hefty cost for repair, i would recommend anyone to please give a second thought before buying VU products and life span of display. As on today VU have discontinued both the products which I had bought.",VU LCd/LED Panel has poor lifespan,B07XK9JSGY

It's a beautiful looking TV, Picture Quality is life like (at recommend viewing distant), Sound is ample enough to fill a room with crisp and clear output (don't spend money buying a sound bar for this TV) and the apps are pretty Swift and easy to navigate (I mean not as swiftly as you can on your laptop or phones, but you'll get the hang of it). Only miss is the voice control remote, would have saved a lot of time typing the content name and don't even think of the Android TV remote its useless But Overall it's definitely an outright winner in the price range of 20k",It's the Mike Tyson of Smart HD TV in budget,B07XK9JSGY

Zero Star for their valuable service. i don't thing Amazon will post my review.",Beware of VU Ultra Android TV,B07XMD275Q
"So, bought this TV during the recent Great Indian sale. 1) This TV is apt for viewing distance of 10-15 feet - Comes with the wall mount. 2) The picture quality and sound is actually good - Not attaching images as I am not good with photography. 3) Pre-installed apps are working fine (Netflix/Zee5/Hotstar/the usual runners). 4) Play store provides ample other options. What's not working: 1) So, this probably is a Amazon Prime issue. I am not sure (need to call Amazon) but my Prime is not working. Like the device is registering to my account however when I try to play the video - I get a msg to go to amazon.com/videohelp. Which really is not helping. I can cast via my phone though so I guess, it's not a complete dead end. 2) Phone mirroring works however lags by a few seconds. Overall, a must buy at the discounted price that I bought it - INR 18k. Final word, a big thank you to the installation team. Missed the first schedule (understandable during sale season) however, second run wasn't a Miss and the guy was good. No hassle and polite.",When a woman reviews,B07XMD275Q

TV installation completed after 12 days... It's disappointed us as the service is poor... But the quality of the TV is very good... Smart TV functionally I didn't check.

The delivery was on time ...but NO one came for installation ... No one called ... Coming to voice - its low ... Amazon prime video - if you are a paid member - still doesn't work ...

"Well for starters the complete playstore is not available. I could not even find Google Chrome but yes the picture quality is excellent and the sound too has become quite good since my first Vu TV. Overall a very good buy. So what exactly did I do for it to work. Firstly stop all updates. Not even system update cause the screen just stays put and nothing gets installed. Next step was to start installing desirable apps & to me the first I needed was a file explorer & a browser I found in playstore by searching just those words. Once that was done I did a system update. Now I can run any App bit Prime Video. When I try to log in it says can't login register on Prime ideo/MyTV. When I give the hashkey provided it says registration successful but on seeing devices registered this TV won't be found. So basically a dead end. Casting is slow but you need to only cast prime video else everything else can be side loaded. That is search for the app on your phone and install it via USB using file explorer. Yes Thope TV, Oreo TV, Typhoon TV, etc will work seamlessly. So basically it is not so simple but once you do everything falls in place. Would I recommend it? Damn well I will for at this price you get an excellent screen, sound again is very good & almost any Android App can be installed. No not Jio TV. I can see only half the screen! Update... Well when folks from VuTv called for feedback I did tell them about the Amazon Prime issue. The caller noted it down and sent me a PDF file containing the solution. It was upgrading OS to a Sep release & doing a reset. Now I had installed Apps & was wary of doing a reset. Now they called again to check if I had done the update or needed help. I said I hadn't done but they said everything would be fine. So I did a reset and was able to login to Amazon Prime & it worked. Also the sluggishness of casting got solved. So I am upgrading the rating to 5 stars from 4...",Thumbs up!! Upgrading to 5 stats,B07XMD275Q

"Amazing Build Quality ,picture and sound and software is a little bit messy at first because Amazon Prime will not work ,so what i did was contacted VU Technical Support and they have released an update of 852 mb.Now you should install that update and once again check Amazon Prime,if the problem persists you should factory reset your smart TV.This will automatically updates the old version to new version and Amazon prime will work Flawlessly.

"Avoid buying from amazon Vu 43"" ultra android tv is a good buy at 21k and value for money, the picture quality and sound quality are good at this price. Also it comes with stock Android 9. The only issue which I have faced is prime video not working properly (which resolved through an update by proactive support from vu customer care) though has separate option in remote and mentioned in offering. It also sometimes responds a bit slow to remote actions. Unless you are ok with spending hours explaining issues to Amazon customer care executives one after another don't buy it from amazon, supposedly there is a large appliance customer care team which, as per my experience, is pathetic. Sharing the issues I have faced so that you are well aware of challenges when you buy any large appliance from Amazon: Installation: The installation guy has not come at the scheduled slot with no information. I was supposed to keep waiting for him. Once the waiting time (1.5 hours) is over I had to spend 3 hours explaining the issue to Amazon customer care, with no resolution. Supposedly there are different teams and call will get transferred to different executives and keep waiting on music (you would be asked to receive a call back from chat executive) and explaining the issue again and again. Finally, they told me they are unable to help. Installation guy came to my place 10 days after the tv delivery. Warranty: Though there was free extended warranty from acko as per the offer when I bought the tv. I have not recieved any information regarding the same. I had contacted Amazon customer care regarding the same and again faced the same pattern. After spending one hour ten mins explaining the issue to different executives I was asked to call again after few hours. Knowing the final response and the hastle I have to go though with Amazon large appliance customer care, I have decided to forget about the extended warranty. I believe a good number of frustrated customers may not follow up for warranty.",Vu ultra Android TV is good but don't buy from amazon,B07XMD275Q

After trying all methods available, customer service asked me to reset the tv and its worked. Just go to setting------device preference-----reset. Remember do not signin with your Google account ( you can do later after prime registration done successfully). Picture quality is superp and videos are sharp and well balanced. Dolby atmos really works and sound is loud enough for my room. Sound is enough even at at 25 - 30 percentage. Impressed with the built quality, easy to setup. Best tv in this budget with Android 9 and with amazon prime support. Customer support is also very quick. I opted this against mi tv and i am happy with my decision.",Promising product from VU.,B07XMD275Q

"For all those whose in built Ch'cast isn't working just change country from USA to India. About the tv. At third of a price compared to known brands with similar features, you simply get what you pay for. Absence of a voice remote irks but considering the performance of the Google app you might as well not have it. Picture is blindingly super bright. I have no idea why the emphasis on bright by all brands. You aren't going to use this in sunlight ... Duh On the brighter side (no pun there lol) the colours produced are very accurate. A piece of advice. Don't judge it by the dth performance. Judge it by playing some good online content. Colours are generally warm and well, getting adjusted from a pana tv the motion seems jerky to me. Sound is loud enough but at times the speakers can't handle the bass and distortion is more than evident. OS is stock android. And well, stock Android always works best, in my opinion that is. Looks... Really nice. It looks really nice, for the price , yes pretty much. Quality... For starters have a look at the picture shared there is something actually sticking out on the left bottom part of the screen ROFL.

"Amazon and installation team did a good job in delivering(10th) and installing the TV as per schedule on 11-10-2019.Thanks. Coming to performance of the tv, it coonected well with WiFi. Not yet tried other smart TV features The picture quality is not good for a FHD TV. Color reproduction is not good with pink skin tone, smudged picture, no sharp pictures. Quite surprised to note that It is like a early vintage CRT TV. Not able to identify distant objects in the screen. Sound is good with stereo and surround sound working well. But, loud annoying sound alerts while scrolling down any menu items in picture modes, sound styles and other settings is a cause of concern. It's only one day after delivery. Watch for 2/3 days and if the performance of the tv doesn't improve, think of returning for exchange. Now after checking it's is found that it's resolution is not 1920X1080. It's only 1280X720p. Not Full HD. Any takers.","Vu 40"" ultraandroid LED TV Average quality not Full HD. It's 720p.",B07XMD275Q
"Nice TV with Android 9 out of the box.Netflix,Hot star & YouTube are working fine, however struggling with Amazon prime... Able To cast however the inbuilt app doesn't work. Awesome Display with good brightness and clarity. Placed as second TV in bedroom and it has very nice stereo speakers with awesome sound and watching movies was fun with clear dialogues. First VU TV and its very impressive. As Usual amazon is the best when it comes to delivery and products. Box contains wall mount as well as stand. The Display panel is what impress me the most. The panel used is definately of high grade with awesome clarity. Let's see how VU perform in long run.",Awesome TV with Great Display.,B07XMD275Q
"Firstly the installation team sucks. No one came for installation until 4 days after the delivery. I would give zero stars for installation. The product is amazing, it's pure androidTV and like everyone else,i too got trouble with Amazon prime video. I just called VU support and their executive came to my home and upated the tv software. Now prime video is working perfectly fine. Inbuilt Chromecast, Bluetooth and all other features are working well. Overall a good value for money.",Worth the money you spent,B07XMD275Q

Can't side load apps (i didn't find options yet ) . At this price range what you expect ;). *The biggest spoiler for VU is that Amazon handles the install services very poorly ,it took a week to get this installed (since DIY install void warranty) .At first it was Amazon app giving error to book slots,afterthat It takes 48+hrs fot site visit.*",Value for money but poor Amazon install service,B07XMD275Q
"Primevideo app started working only after a software upgrade by VU engineer. Netflix, youtube and hotstar are ok. Zee5 was also not working even after upgrade.

"TV is exceptionally good. The picture clarity is excellent. I have one issue though, and that is if sound. The spoken voices in movies are very less audible and the background music is almost twice loud at same volume. If i want to hear the dialogues properly, then the music score blasts through the TV. Can someone help me with this ? Tried almost all settings. Will give 5 star if problem is solved.",VU TV Review,B07XMD275Q
"Pro 1.Sound volume is good but quality is not. 2.Ease of Connectivity is good. 3. Picture Brightness and Contrast are good when viewed right from front (90deg) 4. Composite ports and USB ports responding well but USB 1 is not recognised. Cons 1. Disappointing point is the picture quality when vied from an angle.Against claims of 178deg viewing angle, the quality goes on deteriorating as the angle increases and at 178deg it is bad. 2.The operating Manual is too concise. Just passing mention about Chromecast, Bluetooth etc and if one is not already some sort of an expert, it will be difficult. Overall Fair quality. Value for money.",Overall good,B07XMD275Q
"This review is edited after about a week of use. Good picture quality, decent sound quality. Best of all, excellent value for money esp with the exchange of my old TV. Earlier, I had Netflix, YouTube working fine but I had mentioned that Amazon Prime I wasn't able to sign in, due to some bug. I got an email from Vu detailing the procedure to ensure that Amazon Prime also works. I had to reset to default settings, but after that Amazon Prime has also started working. So all is fine now The delivery was on time, but the installation was delayed by about a week and took several follow ups. But was finally done well.",Very good,B07XMD275Q
Good picture quality & fast installation,Wealth of mony,B07XMD275Q
"The TV is competitively priced with attention to detail in design. An example is during the installation, I noticed that they have taken good care that in a case of wall mount, the mount does not damage the wall & hence some cushion has been provided along. The only which could be improved is the speed. I felt the TV was a bit slower as compared to my other TV although this does not affect the viewing experience & Hotstar takes a long time to load. I am not sure if this is specific to my TV but nothing major as well. Overall a good product in affordable price. I had issues with the installation from Amazon & after escalation, VU themselves made sure the TV is installed on time & checked with me if I am satisfied with the service. That is a really great after sales experience not so common across other brands I use. The person from VU who did the installation was also extremely good & had a good understanding with the installation. The Picture & sound quality is no doubt good for the price. Overall a very pleasant experience so far.",A TV worth the money,B07XMD275Q
"The amazon prime issue is solved by doing a factory reset of the tv. This Tv has decent build quality, picture quality and most of the features you would require factoring in the price you pay. However, what bothers me the most is the poor sound quality. It distorts with a jarring effect whenever there is any sound with bass in it, for example background music, loud noises etc. This happens not only on high volume but on low volume as well as well. The sound comes off as boxy and annoying. Have tried different sound setting as well but can't seem to resolve the issue. Not sure if this problem is being faced by everyone or for my tv alone hence am going to ask for a replacement. Update 1: The Technician that Amazon sent to check the TV has now confirmed that there is a functional problem with the sound of the TV and it needs to be replaced. However, after many phone calls with Amazon customer care they are now telling me that the option to replace the TV is not appearing in their backend system and there is only an option for initiating a refund. However, a refund is not the solution for me as the price for the same model has now gone up by 1500/- on Amazon (from the same seller, Cloudtail), so I can't repurchase the same model at the price I paid. All this while they were assuring me that the TV would be replaced if a fault was found but are now saying that they can only refund the amount paid as the TV is not in stock with the vendor. This is not true as it is still available on the Amazon site through the same vendor albeit at a higher price i.e. 19999/- (instead of 18499/-, which is the amount I paid for it). Since all of this is no fault of mine I do hope they are able to resolve this issue amicably without further delay Update 2: Finally received a replacement for the TV a few days back. But was suspicious as it did not come in the type of packaging as the first TV I received (no protective plastic covering on the outside of the box). Once the technician opened the box to install the same we found out it was a used TV as there was no protective plastic covering the TV inside the box as well, the TV was just placed inside the box with the accessories. The remote batteries were already inside the remote and once the TV was switched on it went directly to the viewing screen without going through any setup. Add to all this the sound issue persisted in this TV as well so had no option but to return the same for a refund. Please be aware that Amazon is recirculating these TVs and hence their customers must make sure that they are infact receiving a new/unused piece. This has been one of the few times I've had a bad experience with Amazon but hopefully they look into the matter.",Very poor sound quality and used TV given as replacement,B07XMD275Q

"The product is very good ... delivery was prompt by Amazon as usual !! The picture quality as well as sound quality is pretty good for the price and the Smart TV features work well !! The latest Android pie as the OS delivered a smooth experience, the TV remote is responsive and having direct buttons for Netflix, Prime Video, YouTube, Hotstar as well as Google Play helps immensely. Bluetooth connectivity is a boon for connecting wireless headphones etc, Casting your phone works pretty well ... etc. etc. Lot of good features that I found useful. I did compare many similar TV's before buying this one, and am not at all disappointed with my decision till date. I would have loved to have 3 HDMI connections, but that is only a minor miss I would say. This is not my main TV (that is a bigger and high-end TV) so I am not comparing the two, I have a fair understanding and appreciation of AV, hence in my judgement this is a very good TV at this price point (maybe better than some products at a little higher price points than this. I would recommend !!",Very good quality and feature rich TV for the price !,B07XMD275Q

"The whole experience with the TV is really good. Amazing picture clarity and sound output is commendable. All the apps works perfectly except Prime Video which is a bummer. Amazon says that the TV is not supported. Not sure why they advertise that it support Prime Video. VFM product if you don't mind the issue with Prime Video. *****Edit***** Changing my rating to 5 Stars. Prashanth from VU called me up and said that the issue should be fixed by updating the software to the latest version. I updated to the latest one (Sept 16th release). It still didn't work. Prashanth asked me to factory reset once. After doing a factory reset, Prime Video started working.

"When I purchased it, I was facing trouble in casting tv with my phone, and zee5 was not working properly, But both problems resolved with first software update. + video quality is good, the sound is loud and clear. UI is good. The problems I can see now is: Half star lost here. 1. The missing feature is: no mic/ voice button on remote + voice feature does not work, you can only type key by key using remote which is very hectic thing, when you could just speak and get things types on screen. Below mentioned 2 points are negligible and can be ignored or might be fixed in upcoming releases. 2. amazon prime not working, but this is working in the Casting feature. 3. sound is a little distorted when we surf/move between apps, only that sound is distorted, tv sound is awesome. Build quality- half star lost here. 4. The screen is not 100% fit and taped on corner boundary, I can see light coming out at some places standing parellet to screen, this point I am not considering since we have paid half the price of LG/ Samsung haha. I got this 40-inch device in 18500, 1000 amazon pay cashback I got and 1850 I will get in SBI bank account cashback, So I got it for 15650 :) + plus point is, got both stands with TV, MItv does not wall mount stand, so save of 400 Rs again. + got Acko 1 year extra warranty from Amazon because of Big festival Sale. Earlier I was confused because of a few above points, but casting resolved half of my doubts :) You can buy it without much doubt.",only voice button mic feature is missing in remote,B07XMD275Q

"Brought Vu premium and Vu UltraAndroid for myself and relatives so here's my short summary. Before getting into the positive I just want to point out the one con i found so far which is the lack fo 3.o Usb ports for the TV it comes with 2 USB 2.0 ports only. Now, Let's get into the picture quality ,the picture quality is really good with good brightness level and contrast. FHD channels looks pretty good too. i don't think you can beat this TV's picture quallity compared to other TVs on a budget, First thing you notice is how well it upscales Videos that are non FHD to look miles better. Espcially when there are still alot of Tv channels in SD,this upscaling feature alone makes the tv worthy along with picture quality. In terms of Android experience it's pretty much Stock android Pie tv experience with occasional lags here and there even high end Android TV's have this issue so not much to complain here. Tv comes with Netflix Amazon prime youtube and hotstar installed with first 3apps getting their own dedicated buttons on the remote . The picture quality through streaming is pretty good too. Coming to the sound quality i found it better then my mi soundbar and prefered to use inbuilt tv speaker.It's got good bass ,clarity and quite loud . Conclusion If you are looking mainly for the picture quality on a budget you should be better going of with this or the non Android VU Ultra Tv for 16k. IF you don't mind spending an extra few thousands you should consider getting the VU premium android 4k not that there are lot of 4k content, but even the FHD channels looks so much better in that tv its more vivid and black levels are deep. Streamed 4k videos though Youtube to my Vu premium the picture quality is great and got great details to it. For full detailed review i found Techiebeez india channel to have good review of this TV.",Probably the Best in-terms of Picture quality for Budget,B07XMD275Q

"As a TV, it is a good buy. The picture and sound is good. TV design is good but its the software that is a let down. the resolution of home screen etc is a let down. Its not sharp at all. Netflix is working but we are unable to use AMAZON prime ( it is a built in app ). Its much better to buy VU Non Smart tv and purchase a Fire Stick or equi. While that was by earlier review. VU sorted out the problem almost immediately and they definitely deserve a mention and a pat on the back. Seems like my SMART TV is SMART once again. We are more than satisfied with the software now that all our grievance have to looked into. I would not only recommend the tv for the display and sound, but also VU as a brand that is Prompt in AFTER SALES.","Be Smart, Dont buy SMART... unless its a VU.",B07XMD275Q
Pros: 1) Picture and Sound Quality is really Good a d besf for viewing at distance of 4 feet. 2) Android TV system UI operates smothly. 3) Got it in RS 10349 during sale and also got RS 1000 in amazon pay as Cashback so Its a value for money product. So good for starters. Cons: 1) There is no Google Voice Assistant in remote so this is a big problem for me. I have to use my phone using Android TV app downloaded from Play Store to use voice assistant using bluetooth (You can also use WiFi) but even it doesn't work well like I can't use it to search using voice on YouTube. Full review soon. Need fix in Android TV UI. 2) Dual core processor is not enough for this TV as it is slow in opening apps. 3) Screen sharing/mirroring lags using Redmi Note 5 Pro phone but my phone cast fine with laptop so its TV problem. My verdict: If you are tight on budget go for this TV as it has very good picture quality.,Good Picture and Sound Quality But Google Assistant is missing in Remote,B07XMD275Q
"This TV has multiple issues. One needs to keep following up with customer service without any response. Bought it 5 days ago. 1. Constant system sound i.e. sound from the left right up down plus clicks is too annoying and there is no way it can be stopped. 2. Picture mode and sound mode buttons on remote so not work in tv mode. 3. TV remote response is slow and lags. Booting takes significant time as well Complaint raised but no updates so far. They accepted that these are the issues but that's how it is and no way out. 4. Cant return so you have to bear the 20k spent. 5. Picture quality is good. 6. Sound is loud but not clear and we end up putting it on very high volume. 7. Not user-friendly and not many apps on the Play Store. Not sure why they named it ultra android when there is nothing special about this android tv. 6. Colours fade when viewed from sides. I will update with other issues if found. Believe me I don't see any features in this tv apart from dedicated buttons on remote for few apps which will be useless if you have hdmi streaming and you can use voice search on jio, firestick etc",Multiple issues and Pathetic customer service,B07XMD275Q

"This TV was delivered to me on 6th & on 9th Oct the installation was done. All good so far. Happy with the sound & picture quality. Most of the Apps are working fine including Netflix. However I have problems connecting to Amazon Prime. Tried several times, entered the Code from the TV to my Amazon login on my computer. I get a success message on the computer but nothing happens on the TV. Tried calling the Amazon toll free no. but no person to speak with. If someone can help me with this would be highly appreciated. Sorry for the late update. Finally a service guy came to check my TV. Sat from 10:30 until 13:30. Tried several things including some downloads and restarts with no positive result. Promised to get back to me in 2 days. I did not hear from him for 4 days. Then I got a call from Mumbai VU who asked me to do certain updates on the TV. I asked him to call back the next day as I would be near the TV. He did call the next day and finally Amazon Prime started working on 6th Nov. (27 days after the TV was delivered). But I was happy. Then 2 days later the technician who came to my office called to say hes coming to fix the problem. I told him it was already sorted. All is well so far with the TV and its a good buy for the price.

Another issue which I am facing is with Jio cinema. I have installed the Jio Cinema app from the playstore. But I am not able to open the app. I am getting the error, unable to process the request, please try again later. Also I am not able to do casting also from jio cinema app from my mobile. I thought this issue also will be resolved after the system reset. But it didn't. If anybody is facing the similar issue and found any solution, please update.

"When I was booking this TV there was no ratings but now I could see plenty of negative comments, To be honest I do not know giving a positive rating at this juncture is correct or not as it is too early to judge/comment, but in my personal opinion on my last 2 days experience the product is very good for its price tag and the working features with the device. Secondly I've gone through all negative reviews and compared it with my TV, unfortunately none of them are valid, Prime is perfectly registered and we finished watching 2 full movie as well. But yes couple of vital things are missing ""Mic enabled remote"" and ""Bluetooth"" with some hiccups here and there but eventually the product is phenomenal in my 2 days experience.",Good TV for its price tag,B07XMD275Q

Excellent smart TV at a very affordable rate. The TV is better than I expected with full functionality. I am thinking of buying same with a bigger screen for another room though I do not require. One can compare it with the most popular brands. Just one issue - The Prime Video app does not register or accept my current id and password and asks to wait which never gets over.

"Bought this 32"" Android TV during Dussehra Sale for a meagre amount which was little less than even 10K. Firstly it was delivered well on time and When I opened the package, I was impressed with the looks. Installation itself is damn easy and I mounted it on the wall. Picture quality, sound quality is awesome and ease of configuring the set with your mobile and broadband is extremely user friendly. The remote has user-friendly keys for direct access to Amazon prime, Netflix, hotstar, YouTube and Google Play. It can be connected by HDMI, USB , cables and even with the phones using MIRACAST. The response to Internet is crisp and overall it's a value for money. I presume that customer support mechanism too should be good because I received mails and phone calls ascertaining about the product satisfaction. Overall an economical buy wherein at this cost you hardly get a decent phone.",Value for Money and loaded with features,B07XMD275Q

"**This is a genuine review posted by a genuine Customer** Placing Order: I have placed the order during the great Indian festival and got a discount on the original price. I have purchased this TV for 21000. I have also opted out for Acko Insurance. Delivery: I live in a city which is connected by railways and transport very well with the major cities like Hyderabad and Banglore. As the seller cloudtail shipped my product from Greater thane I was pretty sure that I will get delivery within 3 days. But that did not happen. Due to the ongoing sale and Diwali holidays, I have received the product after 8 days.Amazon delivered the product within the deadline. First Impression: After the delivery, I have unboxed the TV and put it on the stand given in the box. The setup of the tv is not that difficult as it is an Android TV. After the whole setup, I quickly jumped to the video quality Video: Video quality is better than LG and close to Samsung. Brightness is slightly high but it won't bother you if you are not going to stick to the premium led panels expectations. Audio: Audio quality has impressed me. It is better than the premium rivals. The 20W output is good enough for 10 feet distance. Speed: As it is an android tv, it comes with inbuilt RAM and storage. The 1 GB ram will keep you wait for 30 seconds when you press on from your remote. After 30 seconds the home screen appears. Once you get started there is no such delay in operations. Interface: Interface is stock android and customizable. Connectivity: Wifi, Bluetooth and USB ports works very well Remote: You can handle the majority of tasks using remote and remote has soft textured keys. Installation: For the installation, I had to call VU customer care to place an installation request. The installation guy came after 1day. He was skilled enough to mount the TV properly. I have found VU customer care good enough till now. Overall Comment: I personally think that as my budget was within 25000 rupees and I wanted a tv with youtube and Full HD capabilities, this one is a good choice and my family doesn't watch the TV whole day. It's a good tv and I suggest this tv if you have a budget within 25000 but don't expect too much like sony or any premium brand as you are buying a product considering the price point. I found this TV fulfilling all my needs. I have chosen this TV over price and I am very satisfied with my choice. I didn't want to purchase a TV worth 44K just to watch for 1 hour. Overall I will rate this TV 4 stars. If brightness is adjusted and some more RAM is given then I would have might give it 5 stars.",I Am Satisfied With My Choice,B07XMD275Q

"Nice TV, worth the money you spend on a budget TV. Amazon prime working only after updating the system software. Everything is fine, prime working perfectly fine after updation. Picture quality good, sound is good for you tube and DTH connection but a little bit low with the Amazon prime and Netflix. Overall a good smart android TV in budget with inbuilt features. 3 days of using but satisfied till now.",Nice TV,B07XMD275Q
"Pros- *Picture quality is surprisingly awesome considering price. *Colours are prominent. *Sound quality is excellent. *Built quality is acceptable. *SD video quality on cable boxes are managble. *Hd,fhd videos played excellently. *Google Chromecast works fine. *Many popular apps works fine Cons- *Loading time sometimes take 10-12 seconds. *Built quality could have been more stylish but obviously couldn't ask more as competitive mrp offered. *Installation service finalized 5 days after my scheduled date. *Don't have voice recognition, i have to connect my mobile remote with TV for voice recognition. Conclusion:-Doesn't found many weakness in the TV except service delayed. Purchased at around 16000(after discount) on Amazon festival sale.",With 40GA VU set very high standards for others to compete,B07XMD275Q
Product support is good. Prime videos working properly after updating software. We can download latest update from their site. Dolby digital audio is good. Music is little dominating voice. Still its give you awsome experience if you can increse the sound. Good product in this price range. They reacted immediately to update my software. Thanks,Awesome product with good and immediate customer support.,B07XMD275Q
"Got the product for 10,349 after discount. Picture quality is very good in this price range. Sound quality is also good for a small room. Few drawbacks which i noticed after 10days of usage are 1. Zee5 app is crashing 2. Even if you sign in to amazon prime, once you come out of the app and go back it asks to sign in again. 3. Overall i felt the response of the apps are little slow. Could have been little faster. I dont notice this in my TCL 55inch TV.",Value for Money product.,B07XMD275Q
"Very Good Deal, picture and sound quality is good. Connectivity is seamless (WiFi, Bluetooth, Casting), package included a wall mount. Took a while to resolve the Amazon Prime app issue. The issue is that after login to Amazon Prime app, it will ask additional registration on primevideo/mytv site. Even after registering, the app doesn't proceed further. This issue was resolved after following the 2 steps: 1. System Update (Settings, About the Phone, System Update) 2. If the above doesn't solve, do a factory reset. (Settings, About the Phone, Reset)",Value Buy TV,B07XMD275Q
I bought this television as it's features were awesome but when the tv arrived and i started using it i started noticing defects. 1. When we increase volume the audio started to distort when ever watching movie background music and sound started to mix and can't able to hear that sound. 2. Front pannel is not well placed in it. It's cause of the company cheap quality of plastic that they have used in television the front bezels are coming off due to which the light leaks this is with all vu televisions as i replaced it with another and found same defect in it . I have atached pictures of that . Think once before buying this television.,Worst company to in terms of quality,B07XMD275Q
After sale service is very poor. I received product on 17th October 2019. Received mail regarding installation on 2nd Nov 2019. Now I received mail that my installation date is not confirmed. They also did not tell when they are going to install tv,After sale service is very poor.,B07XMD275Q
"I am quite happy with my purchase of Vu 40GA. The picture quality of this tv is very good with wonderful rendition of HD content. The sound quality though depends a great deal on the source. Bluetooth connectivity, playback from USB drives, casting from smart phone all work well. Even composite input from an old DVD player via an old A/V cable gets reproduced without any hitch. The only thing lacking is mic support on the remote for Google Assistant. Had it been present, it would have been a perfect addition to the hotkeys for Netflix, Prime Video, YouTube and Google Play on the remote.",Excellent affordable smart Android TV,B07XMD275Q

"I bought this tv this September for 9.2k. After 10days of use I'm reviewing this product. Pros : 1. Dedicated buttons for Amazon Prime, Netflix, YouTube,Hotstar. 2. Picture Quality is good. 3. Sound quality is awesome. 4. U will get wall mount with tv. 5. Connects with WiFi easily. 6. Build quality is good. 7. Android 9 pie version. Cons : 1. No Google assistance. 2. Every time u have to login to Amazon prime when u turn on Ur tv. Which is irritating. No remember me option. For this range I don't think u will get better TV. So my advice go for it.",Very good TV with awesome sound quality.,B07XMD275Q
"Initially i was hesitant to buy VU brand. But this is for my parents , the were using old CRT TV.so wanted to upgrade it. Confusion between vu,MI,micromax,tcl and Santo. But many social media ppl replied with VU tv with half mind. Even i got offer for LV TV around 13k. But already i had LG TV, it was having diplay issue. Every 2 years, inside led plastics fell off. And spent 5000 every two years. So i don't want to go for LG brand. And ordered this vu android latest TV. Since it's new to the market, I didn't get many reviews. With half minded i ordered. Tv reached earlier than expected (remote village in Tamilnadu).. But installation didn't happen at scheduled time. 4 days later. So i saw my TV installed 2 days back only. Its not HD but HD Ready. But quality of video is perfect HD for 32 inches. Played Netflix and YouTube videos seamlessly... Many ppl reviewed other VU branda having low volume...no... Its sound volume is more than expected. For my family its enough. Dolby effect also gud . ( if u need more effect pls go for home theatre) Netflix, hotstar and YouTube with remote buttons, we can get easily. ( in hotstar i couldn't able to select subtitles) I reduced one star because, amazon prime button in remote. But its having login issues. Even though we registered out TV in amazon page, I can't run amazon prime in this TV. But its having Inbuilt Chromecast. So u can cast all from ur mobile to TV. Now i can't tell abt durability, but its worth for every penny... I think VU is cheap and best. Simply go for it ❤❤❤❤",Good and budget TV. Must buy if u need good issue logfing smart TV,B07XMD275Q
"Absolutely brilliant! I was little skeptical about buying it since it was offering so much for so little. Its a 32 inch smart tv which offers great colours and contrast and surprisingly the white balance offered is good at this price. Sound quality is fine though not great. Smart TV features are working smoothly (youtube, Amazon prime, sonyliv ) i had no issues while launching applications or while streaming them infact i can compare it with my firestick which i have for my other room. It also has a blutooth receiver as well The build quality is more than acceptable. It doesn't feel clumsy at all, the provided Remote is also sturdy and its buttons are responsive. The only thing which is at the downside is the OSD menu which could have been better in terms of screen positioning and the user interface ... Anybody who wants to buy a smart tv should not think twice ..just go for it ! Its a steal at the current discounts and offers ..",Simply Awesome,B07XMD275Q
"I am glad that i choosed this one over other brands and even bigger brands. Pros: Seamless internet connectivity Easy interface Awesome colors whether SD or HD Shortcuts app buttons on remote All app woking well. Amazon app had an issue, however updating android feom app and resetting the tv resolved this. Working with out any lag now. Played games in 32 inches version and compeltely a good experience. Pairing easy with blutooth devices. Jio cimema supported. Cons: Volumen is loud, but 100% clear. This does not mean it will impact voice, buy this without any hesitation. No blutooth remote which is necceessary now a days. Its not there i guess in any of the size i guess but not sure. ChromeCast does not work very well. Lag on the screen, i can say its not usable in this kind of lag Not much content available.",This Tv beats big brands!,B07XMD275Q
"OK this is an update. The sound stopped working after 5 days but has since come back. Don't know why. Amazon not helpful on the matter in any case. The menu is slow but it's a good picture, and sound (when it works). Easy to set up. Just play and play. Very light in weight. Only gripe is when Sky box is on, the volume control on the sky isn't working. Only TV volume works. Voice recognition doesn't work at all.",It's OK.,B07XMD275Q

"I bought this after comparing it with many other branded TVs such as Samsung, Xiaomi, LG, Motorola, etc. But finally decided to buy this because it's an Indian brand and the features and quality it offers are comparable to those Big brands as Samsung and LG and can easily beat Chinese made TVs in terms of display and sound quality & clarity. I recommend this TV to all those who are in a tight budget but want a really good picture quality and sound in a TV that too from an Indian Brand. Also latest Android 9.0, Bluetooth 5.0 and Chromcast works very well. The interface is easy to operate. Also, you get five shortcut keys for each streaming media (Hotstar, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Youtube) in remote itself, so no hassle. I faced no connectivity issues so far. As far as voice control is concerned, one can use their smartphones to operate their tv via Google Assistance, you just need to download the Google assistance app and apply settings to it.",Best Offering from an Indian Brand.,B07XMD275Q

"40"" Bought in 16010/- (with icici discount). Amazon allow to check product with ""free open box verification"" which is really helful. Nice picture clarity, good contrast ratio, there is li'l bit vibrating voice/music on high volume, 1080i videos plays smoothly. But wait.... there is lot of hectic for installation. My TV has been installed after 19 days from the product delivery. after 1 time service man refuse to came due to traffic and 2 times VECARE (amazon's vendor) appoint the service man which was not belongs to my area.

"I got the 40 inch Vu Smart android TV and it is just awesome at this price. I bought it in amazon sale. Initially all the apps(Netflix, Youtube, Hotstar, Zee5) were working fine expect prime video which was disappointing but the installation guy installed some update of 840 MB, reset the TV settings and then all apps were working smoothly. The clarity is amazing and is visible clearly from any angle. Though I was not impressed with the sound but that can be ignored as most of the TV's do not have awesome sound. I have compensated that with JBL soundbar and now its superb experience for me. For this price range this Vu TV fulfills all the criteria and if you want are planning to buy go for this.",Very nice for this price range.,B07XMD275Q
"It's been 10 days and so far my experience with VU Ultra Android range has been phenomenal. The picture quality is really vibrant and vivid. The colours are perfect in this range. The display is far better than it's competitors and also the colours seem pretty natural. Coming to the sound section, the 20W surround sound Dolby system is absolutely mind blowing. The voice is clear and the music just mellows your ears. The bass and everything is pretty good and at this price point everything works phenomenal. Netflix works perfectly. Every other Android supported application runs the same. The Chromecast feature also works flawlessly. The only issue I have faced is with Amazon Prime video. The TV supports the app. But the app has not been registered with Vu TVs till now. So registering of the device doesn't work. So using amazon video works currently with Chromecast feature only. Apart from this everything is perfect.",Best Smart TV under 20k,B07XMD275Q

"The installer came and gave a quick demo but was not equipped to activate the voice recognition feature. Hence I have given a blank rating on that. The screen cast / mirroring experience is pathetic. The audio is immediately casted from my Android phone to the TV, but the pictures follow after a delay of over 20 secs. I have absolutely no delay when I use a Chromecast device cast fitted on a normal (non-Smart) Sanyo TV over the same wi-fi network. The users manual is also below expectation. It does not even mention the exact model of the TV set purchased. So I am left wondering whether they made a packing mistake or just don't care about perfection.","Promised a world class experience, but fell short",B07XMD275Q

The Os and everything is good but the sound speakers distorts so much that it is noticeable and is really annoying For people geeting same problem i would recommend them using the tv in user sound mode (it can be changed thround S Mode button on remote) or by going to settings and use equalizer detail and reduce 150-200 hz by at least -40db Overall it is a best for value tv but however the sound issue is really annoying (idk if only i am getting it),Sound issue,B07XMD275Q

Tv is awesome and it works fine. Though there are some lapse in installtation as the installation person is in hurry and went without proper installation. As a result amazon prime wasnt working.. I had to do factory reset and install TV all my own and install everything and the TV works fine now. All pre installed apps are working fine.. They should have given a microphone with the remote it's cumbersome to type all the time.,TV is great but can be improved (service installation and adding microphone in the remote),B07XMD275Q

"When VU launched in India with LCD screen, i was impressed by there picture quality during that time. My First LCD was from VU which didn't gave issue for good 7 Years. After that it started giving LCD panel issue and went blank. Since Technologies changed LED gave better quality i thought to go for the VU LED TV. These was the second from VU, which i bought 2 years back. Today as i Write this second VU product gave the same issue, LED Panel display has gone blank. When the VU technician visit to check the issue, the option given is to replace the Display Panel. Which cost equivalent to new one. Also they have scripted answer, with Humidity /moisture this are common issues. I read some of the blogs this is one of the common issue reported by other user. With 2 experience by now the hefty cost for repair, i would recommend anyone to please give a second thought before buying VU products and life span of display. As on today VU have discontinued both the products which I had bought.",VU LCd/LED Panel has poor lifespan,B07XMD275Q

"Amazing product from VU...This is my first Smart HD TV, and I realize what I have been missing all these years.... It's a beautiful looking TV, Picture Quality is life like (at recommend viewing distant), Sound is ample enough to fill a room with crisp and clear output (don't spend money buying a sound bar for this TV) and the apps are pretty Swift and easy to navigate (I mean not as swiftly as you can on your laptop or phones, but you'll get the hang of it). Only miss is the voice control remote, would have saved a lot of time typing the content name and don't even think of the Android TV remote its useless But Overall it's definitely an outright winner in the price range of 20k",It's the Mike Tyson of Smart HD TV in budget,B07XMD275Q

"So, bought this TV during the recent Great Indian sale. 1) This TV is apt for viewing distance of 10-15 feet - Comes with the wall mount. 2) The picture quality and sound is actually good - Not attaching images as I am not good with photography. 3) Pre-installed apps are working fine (Netflix/Zee5/Hotstar/the usual runners). 4) Play store provides ample other options. What's not working: 1) So, this probably is a Amazon Prime issue. I am not sure (need to call Amazon) but my Prime is not working. Like the device is registering to my account however when I try to play the video - I get a msg to go to amazon.com/videohelp. Which really is not helping. I can cast via my phone though so I guess, it's not a complete dead end. 2) Phone mirroring works however lags by a few seconds. Overall, a must buy at the discounted price that I bought it - INR 18k. Final word, a big thank you to the installation team. Missed the first schedule (understandable during sale season) however, second run wasn't a Miss and the guy was good. No hassle and polite.",When a woman reviews,B07XMD275S

"Well for starters the complete playstore is not available. I could not even find Google Chrome but yes the picture quality is excellent and the sound too has become quite good since my first Vu TV. Overall a very good buy. So what exactly did I do for it to work. Firstly stop all updates. Not even system update cause the screen just stays put and nothing gets installed. Next step was to start installing desirable apps & to me the first I needed was a file explorer & a browser I found in playstore by searching just those words. Once that was done I did a system update. Now I can run any App bit Prime Video. When I try to log in it says can't login register on Prime ideo/MyTV. When I give the hashkey provided it says registration successful but on seeing devices registered this TV won't be found. So basically a dead end. Casting is slow but you need to only cast prime video else everything else can be side loaded. That is search for the app on your phone and install it via USB using file explorer. Yes Thope TV, Oreo TV, Typhoon TV, etc will work seamlessly. So basically it is not so simple but once you do everything falls in place. Would I recommend it? Damn well I will for at this price you get an excellent screen, sound again is very good & almost any Android App can be installed. No not Jio TV. I can see only half the screen! Update... Well when folks from VuTv called for feedback I did tell them about the Amazon Prime issue. The caller noted it down and sent me a PDF file containing the solution. It was upgrading OS to a Sep release & doing a reset. Now I had installed Apps & was wary of doing a reset. Now they called again to check if I had done the update or needed help. I said I hadn't done but they said everything would be fine. So I did a reset and was able to login to Amazon Prime & it worked. Also the sluggishness of casting got solved.

Bought a 43 inch variant as I needed a secondary tv. It's been a week now and I'm totally satisfied with the purchase. Was a bit disappointed when amazon prime refused to sign me in even after multiple attempts. Did some research and reset the tv from home screen - settings and wolla! Prime works like a charm now. Good buy for the price point. Extended warranty of 2 yrs is available through vu for a very reasonable price!,Good buy,B07XMD275S
Amazon and VU trying to fool the customers. The advertisement for this TV having Amazon prime everywhere but it won't work on this TV.,Why Amazon,B07XMD275S
Quality of the TV is nice and has very good options in this low cost. I am unable to sign in the pre-installed prime video app and when asked the prime video support team they informed me that currently VU tv is not supported for Prime Video. Then why the amazon advertising the prime video app with the main picture of the tv and with pre-installed app. Useless app finally...,Good Quality and nice options...,B07XMD275S

"Avoid buying from amazon Vu 43"" ultra android tv is a good buy at 21k and value for money, the picture quality and sound quality are good at this price. Also it comes with stock Android 9. The only issue which I have faced is prime video not working properly (which resolved through an update by proactive support from vu customer care) though has separate option in remote and mentioned in offering. It also sometimes responds a bit slow to remote actions. Unless you are ok with spending hours explaining issues to Amazon customer care executives one after another don't buy it from amazon, supposedly there is a large appliance customer care team which, as per my experience, is pathetic. Sharing the issues I have faced so that you are well aware of challenges when you buy any large appliance from Amazon: Installation: The installation guy has not come at the scheduled slot with no information. I was supposed to keep waiting for him. Once the waiting time (1.5 hours) is over I had to spend 3 hours explaining the issue to Amazon customer care, with no resolution. Supposedly there are different teams and call will get transferred to different executives and keep waiting on music (you would be asked to receive a call back from chat executive) and explaining the issue again and again. Finally, they told me they are unable to help. Installation guy came to my place 10 days after the tv delivery. Warranty: Though there was free extended warranty from acko as per the offer when I bought the tv. I have not recieved any information regarding the same. I had contacted Amazon customer care regarding the same and again faced the same pattern. After spending one hour ten mins explaining the issue to different executives I was asked to call again after few hours. Knowing the final response and the hastle I have to go though with Amazon large appliance customer care, I have decided to forget about the extended warranty. I believe a good number of frustrated customers may not follow up for warranty.",Vu ultra Android TV is good but don't buy from amazon,B07XMD275S

Disappointing point is the picture quality when vied from an angle.Against claims of 178deg viewing angle, the quality goes on deteriorating as the angle increases and at 178deg it is bad. 2.The operating Manual is too concise. Just passing mention about Chromecast, Bluetooth etc and if one is not already some sort of an expert, it will be difficult. Overall Fair quality. Value for money.",Overall good,B07XMD275S
"This review is edited after about a week of use. Good picture quality, decent sound quality. Best of all, excellent value for money esp with the exchange of my old TV. Earlier, I had Netflix, YouTube working fine but I had mentioned that Amazon Prime I wasn't able to sign in, due to some bug. I got an email from Vu detailing the procedure to ensure that Amazon Prime also works. I had to reset to default settings, but after that Amazon Prime has also started working. So all is fine now The delivery was on time, but the installation was delayed by about a week and took several follow ups. But was finally done well.",Very good,B07XMD275S
Good picture quality & fast installation,Wealth of mony,B07XMD275S
"The TV is competitively priced with attention to detail in design. An example is during the installation, I noticed that they have taken good care that in a case of wall mount, the mount does not damage the wall & hence some cushion has been provided along. The only which could be improved is the speed. I felt the TV was a bit slower as compared to my other TV although this does not affect the viewing experience & Hotstar takes a long time to load. I am not sure if this is specific to my TV but nothing major as well. Overall a good product in affordable price. I had issues with the installation from Amazon & after escalation, VU themselves made sure the TV is installed on time & checked with me if I am satisfied with the service. That is a really great after sales experience not so common across other brands I use. The person from VU who did the installation was also extremely good & had a good understanding with the installation. The Picture & sound quality is no doubt good for the price. Overall a very pleasant experience so far.",A TV worth the money,B07XMD275S
"The amazon prime issue is solved by doing a factory reset of the tv. This Tv has decent build quality, picture quality and most of the features you would require factoring in the price you pay. However, what bothers me the most is the poor sound quality. It distorts with a jarring effect whenever there is any sound with bass in it, for example background music, loud noises etc. This happens not only on high volume but on low volume as well as well. The sound comes off as boxy and annoying. Have tried different sound setting as well but can't seem to resolve the issue. Not sure if this problem is being faced by everyone or for my tv alone hence am going to ask for a replacement. Update 1: The Technician that Amazon sent to check the TV has now confirmed that there is a functional problem with the sound of the TV and it needs to be replaced. However, after many phone calls with Amazon customer care they are now telling me that the option to replace the TV is not appearing in their backend system and there is only an option for initiating a refund. However, a refund is not the solution for me as the price for the same model has now gone up by 1500/- on Amazon (from the same seller, Cloudtail), so I can't repurchase the same model at the price I paid. All this while they were assuring me that the TV would be replaced if a fault was found but are now saying that they can only refund the amount paid as the TV is not in stock with the vendor. This is not true as it is still available on the Amazon site through the same vendor albeit at a higher price i.e. 19999/- (instead of 18499/-, which is the amount I paid for it). Since all of this is no fault of mine I do hope they are able to resolve this issue amicably without further delay Update 2: Finally received a replacement for the TV a few days back. But was suspicious as it did not come in the type of packaging as the first TV I received (no protective plastic covering on the outside of the box). Once the technician opened the box to install the same we found out it was a used TV as there was no protective plastic covering the TV inside the box as well, the TV was just placed inside the box with the accessories. The remote batteries were already inside the remote and once the TV was switched on it went directly to the viewing screen without going through any setup. Add to all this the sound issue persisted in this TV as well so had no option but to return the same for a refund. Please be aware that Amazon is recirculating these TVs and hence their customers must make sure that they are infact receiving a new/unused piece. This has been one of the few times I've had a bad experience with Amazon but hopefully they look into the matter.",Very poor sound quality and used TV given as replacement,B07XMD275S

"The product is very good ... delivery was prompt by Amazon as usual !! The picture quality as well as sound quality is pretty good for the price and the Smart TV features work well !! The latest Android pie as the OS delivered a smooth experience, the TV remote is responsive and having direct buttons for Netflix, Prime Video, YouTube, Hotstar as well as Google Play helps immensely. Bluetooth connectivity is a boon for connecting wireless headphones etc, Casting your phone works pretty well ... etc. etc. Lot of good features that I found useful. I did compare many similar TV's before buying this one, and am not at all disappointed with my decision till date. I would have loved to have 3 HDMI connections, but that is only a minor miss I would say. This is not my main TV (that is a bigger and high-end TV) so I am not comparing the two, I have a fair understanding and appreciation of AV, hence in my judgement this is a very good TV at this price point (maybe better than some products at a little higher price points than this. I would recommend !!",Very good quality and feature rich TV for the price !,B07XMD275S

Amazon says that the TV is not supported. Not sure why they advertise that it support Prime Video. VFM product if you don't mind the issue with Prime Video. *****Edit***** Changing my rating to 5 Stars. Prashanth from VU called me up and said that the issue should be fixed by updating the software to the latest version. I updated to the latest one (Sept 16th release). It still didn't work.

"When I purchased it, I was facing trouble in casting tv with my phone, and zee5 was not working properly, But both problems resolved with first software update. + video quality is good, the sound is loud and clear. UI is good. The problems I can see now is: Half star lost here. 1. The missing feature is: no mic/ voice button on remote + voice feature does not work, you can only type key by key using remote which is very hectic thing, when you could just speak and get things types on screen. Below mentioned 2 points are negligible and can be ignored or might be fixed in upcoming releases. 2. amazon prime not working, but this is working in the Casting feature. 3. sound is a little distorted when we surf/move between apps, only that sound is distorted, tv sound is awesome. Build quality- half star lost here. 4. The screen is not 100% fit and taped on corner boundary, I can see light coming out at some places standing parellet to screen, this point I am not considering since we have paid half the price of LG/ Samsung haha. I got this 40-inch device in 18500, 1000 amazon pay cashback I got and 1850 I will get in SBI bank account cashback, So I got it for 15650 :) + plus point is, got both stands with TV, MItv does not wall mount stand, so save of 400 Rs again. + got Acko 1 year extra warranty from Amazon because of Big festival Sale.

"Brought Vu premium and Vu UltraAndroid for myself and relatives so here's my short summary. Before getting into the positive I just want to point out the one con i found so far which is the lack fo 3.o Usb ports for the TV it comes with 2 USB 2.0 ports only. Now, Let's get into the picture quality ,the picture quality is really good with good brightness level and contrast. FHD channels looks pretty good too. i don't think you can beat this TV's picture quallity compared to other TVs on a budget, First thing you notice is how well it upscales Videos that are non FHD to look miles better. Espcially when there are still alot of Tv channels in SD,this upscaling feature alone makes the tv worthy along with picture quality. In terms of Android experience it's pretty much Stock android Pie tv experience with occasional lags here and there even high end Android TV's have this issue so not much to complain here. Tv comes with Netflix Amazon prime youtube and hotstar installed with first 3apps getting their own dedicated buttons on the remote . The picture quality through streaming is pretty good too. Coming to the sound quality i found it better then my mi soundbar and prefered to use inbuilt tv speaker.It's got good bass ,clarity and quite loud . Conclusion If you are looking mainly for the picture quality on a budget you should be better going of with this or the non Android VU Ultra Tv for 16k. IF you don't mind spending an extra few thousands you should consider getting the VU premium android 4k not that there are lot of 4k content, but even the FHD channels looks so much better in that tv its more vivid and black levels are deep. Streamed 4k videos though Youtube to my Vu premium the picture quality is great and got great details to it. For full detailed review i found Techiebeez india channel to have good review of this TV.",Probably the Best in-terms of Picture quality for Budget,B07XMD275S

"As a TV, it is a good buy. The picture and sound is good. TV design is good but its the software that is a let down. the resolution of home screen etc is a let down. Its not sharp at all. Netflix is working but we are unable to use AMAZON prime ( it is a built in app ). Its much better to buy VU Non Smart tv and purchase a Fire Stick or equi. While that was by earlier review. VU sorted out the problem almost immediately and they definitely deserve a mention and a pat on the back. Seems like my SMART TV is SMART once again. We are more than satisfied with the software now that all our grievance have to looked into. I would not only recommend the tv for the display and sound, but also VU as a brand that is Prompt in AFTER SALES.","Be Smart, Dont buy SMART... unless its a VU.",B07XMD275S
Pros: 1) Picture and Sound Quality is really Good a d besf for viewing at distance of 4 feet. 2) Android TV system UI operates smothly. 3) Got it in RS 10349 during sale and also got RS 1000 in amazon pay as Cashback so Its a value for money product. So good for starters. Cons: 1) There is no Google Voice Assistant in remote so this is a big problem for me. I have to use my phone using Android TV app downloaded from Play Store to use voice assistant using bluetooth (You can also use WiFi) but even it doesn't work well like I can't use it to search using voice on YouTube. Full review soon. Need fix in Android TV UI. 2) Dual core processor is not enough for this TV as it is slow in opening apps. 3) Screen sharing/mirroring lags using Redmi Note 5 Pro phone but my phone cast fine with laptop so its TV problem. My verdict: If you are tight on budget go for this TV as it has very good picture quality.,Good Picture and Sound Quality But Google Assistant is missing in Remote,B07XMD275S
"This TV has multiple issues. One needs to keep following up with customer service without any response. Bought it 5 days ago. 1. Constant system sound i.e. sound from the left right up down plus clicks is too annoying and there is no way it can be stopped. 2. Picture mode and sound mode buttons on remote so not work in tv mode. 3. TV remote response is slow and lags. Booting takes significant time as well Complaint raised but no updates so far. They accepted that these are the issues but that's how it is and no way out. 4. Cant return so you have to bear the 20k spent. 5. Picture quality is good. 6. Sound is loud but not clear and we end up putting it on very high volume. 7. Not user-friendly and not many apps on the Play Store. Not sure why they named it ultra android when there is nothing special about this android tv. 6. Colours fade when viewed from sides. I will update with other issues if found. Believe me I don't see any features in this tv apart from dedicated buttons on remote for few apps which will be useless if you have hdmi streaming and you can use voice search on jio, firestick etc",Multiple issues and Pathetic customer service,B07XMD275S

He did call the next day and finally Amazon Prime started working on 6th Nov. (27 days after the TV was delivered). But I was happy.

This should be clearly stated on the product details so the buyer knows what he is buying. Very disappointed with the product.",Wrong product details and specs,B07XMD275S
"Almost all the points were covered in other reviews from various customers. I don't want to repeat them again. Based on my usage from one week I felt picture clarity is very good, sound is also good. no need to separate speakers unless you want high woofer effects. I had faced issue with promevideo like many other users. I was able to resolve it by resetting the settings. Thanks for the solution by some users in the reviews section. Another issue which I am facing is with Jio cinema. I have installed the Jio Cinema app from the playstore. But I am not able to open the app. I am getting the error, unable to process the request, please try again later. Also I am not able to do casting also from jio cinema app from my mobile. I thought this issue also will be resolved after the system reset. But it didn't. If anybody is facing the similar issue and found any solution, please update. Apart from that all other apps are working fine. It is very good deal from amazon during the great Indian festival. I will add more points after exploring the product in detail.",Very smart for this price,B07XMD275S
"This is my first android tv and hope that I get a good experience using it for at least 6-7 years. My initial review is, picture and sound quality is good, wi-fi connectivity is also good, it is easier to setup, HD content is awesome, SD content with my IN cable setup box is ok. Overall a happy customer as I got it a good price.",Good tv with aggressive pricing,B07XMD275S
"1. Amazon Prime works fine on some occasions, but not able to store credentials, so again and again login is required. 2. On some occasions, composite video souce is not detected, so we have to give restart to tv, then it works. 3. Default source selection option is not available, so u need tv remote every time u need to watch your dish tv. Within two days vu support team visited the home and resolved almost all issues. Default input selection is not possible in this model, so keep TV remote along with cable TV remote. I am satisfied with the support and resolution.",Good tv with few setbacks,B07XMD275S
After 2 days of installation date. My TV doesn't working. Unacceptable issue,Bad Experience,B07XMD275S
"When I was booking this TV there was no ratings but now I could see plenty of negative comments, To be honest I do not know giving a positive rating at this juncture is correct or not as it is too early to judge/comment, but in my personal opinion on my last 2 days experience the product is very good for its price tag and the working features with the device. Secondly I've gone through all negative reviews and compared it with my TV, unfortunately none of them are valid, Prime is perfectly registered and we finished watching 2 full movie as well. But yes couple of vital things are missing ""Mic enabled remote"" and ""Bluetooth"" with some hiccups here and there but eventually the product is phenomenal in my 2 days experience.",Good TV for its price tag,B07XMD275S
"Picture quality is good even SD channels are viewable. HD contents from YouTube and Prime video are good to enjoy. Sound quality is not disappointing It would be great if I got voice remote with the TV, which is an added advantage in Motorola TV Overall good after one week usage For prime video registration issues update the system software and reset the device, now you can register in prime video.",One week usage rating,B07XMD275S
Excellent smart TV at a very affordable rate. The TV is better than I expected with full functionality. I am thinking of buying same with a bigger screen for another room though I do not require. One can compare it with the most popular brands. Just one issue - The Prime Video app does not register or accept my current id and password and asks to wait which never gets over. Tried many times in different ways. The Prime Video app works fine in other brand TV.,Amazing product,B07XMD275S
"Very Good Deal, picture and sound quality is good. Connectivity is seamless (WiFi, Bluetooth, Casting), package included a wall mount. Took a while to resolve the Amazon Prime app issue. The issue is that after login to Amazon Prime app, it will ask additional registration on primevideo/mytv site. Even after registering, the app doesn't proceed further. This issue was resolved after following the 2 steps: 1. System Update (Settings, About the Phone, System Update) 2. If the above doesn't solve, do a factory reset. (Settings, About the Phone, Reset)",Value Buy TV,B07XMD275S
I bought this television as it's features were awesome but when the tv arrived and i started using it i started noticing defects. 1. When we increase volume the audio started to distort when ever watching movie background music and sound started to mix and can't able to hear that sound. 2. Front pannel is not well placed in it. It's cause of the company cheap quality of plastic that they have used in television the front bezels are coming off due to which the light leaks this is with all vu televisions as i replaced it with another and found same defect in it . I have atached pictures of that . Think once before buying this television.,Worst company to in terms of quality,B07XMD275S
After sale service is very poor. I received product on 17th October 2019. Received mail regarding installation on 2nd Nov 2019. Now I received mail that my installation date is not confirmed. They also did not tell when they are going to install tv,After sale service is very poor.,B07XMD275S
"I am quite happy with my purchase of Vu 40GA. The picture quality of this tv is very good with wonderful rendition of HD content. The sound quality though depends a great deal on the source. Bluetooth connectivity, playback from USB drives, casting from smart phone all work well. Even composite input from an old DVD player via an old A/V cable gets reproduced without any hitch. The only thing lacking is mic support on the remote for Google Assistant. Had it been present, it would have been a perfect addition to the hotkeys for Netflix, Prime Video, YouTube and Google Play on the remote.",Excellent affordable smart Android TV,B07XMD275S

"I bought this tv this September for 9.2k. After 10days of use I'm reviewing this product. Pros : 1. Dedicated buttons for Amazon Prime, Netflix, YouTube,Hotstar. 2. Picture Quality is good. 3. Sound quality is awesome. 4. U will get wall mount with tv. 5. Connects with WiFi easily. 6. Build quality is good. 7. Android 9 pie version. Cons : 1. No Google assistance. 2. Every time u have to login to Amazon prime when u turn on Ur tv. Which is irritating. No remember me option. For this range I don't think u will get better TV. So my advice go for it.",Very good TV with awesome sound quality.,B07XMD275S
"Initially i was hesitant to buy VU brand. But this is for my parents , the were using old CRT TV.so wanted to upgrade it. Confusion between vu,MI,micromax,tcl and Santo. But many social media ppl replied with VU tv with half mind. Even i got offer for LV TV around 13k. But already i had LG TV, it was having diplay issue. Every 2 years, inside led plastics fell off. And spent 5000 every two years. So i don't want to go for LG brand. And ordered this vu android latest TV. Since it's new to the market, I didn't get many reviews. With half minded i ordered. Tv reached earlier than expected (remote village in Tamilnadu).. But installation didn't happen at scheduled time. 4 days later. So i saw my TV installed 2 days back only. Its not HD but HD Ready. But quality of video is perfect HD for 32 inches. Played Netflix and YouTube videos seamlessly... Many ppl reviewed other VU branda having low volume...no... Its sound volume is more than expected. For my family its enough. Dolby effect also gud . ( if u need more effect pls go for home theatre) Netflix, hotstar and YouTube with remote buttons, we can get easily. ( in hotstar i couldn't able to select subtitles) I reduced one star because, amazon prime button in remote. But its having login issues. Even though we registered out TV in amazon page, I can't run amazon prime in this TV. But its having Inbuilt Chromecast. So u can cast all from ur mobile to TV. Now i can't tell abt durability, but its worth for every penny... I think VU is cheap and best. Simply go for it ❤❤❤❤",Good and budget TV. Must buy if u need good issue logfing smart TV,B07XMD275S
"Absolutely brilliant! I was little skeptical about buying it since it was offering so much for so little. Its a 32 inch smart tv which offers great colours and contrast and surprisingly the white balance offered is good at this price. Sound quality is fine though not great. Smart TV features are working smoothly (youtube, Amazon prime, sonyliv ) i had no issues while launching applications or while streaming them infact i can compare it with my firestick which i have for my other room. It also has a blutooth receiver as well The build quality is more than acceptable. It doesn't feel clumsy at all, the provided Remote is also sturdy and its buttons are responsive. The only thing which is at the downside is the OSD menu which could have been better in terms of screen positioning and the user interface ... Anybody who wants to buy a smart tv should not think twice ..just go for it ! Its a steal at the current discounts and offers ..",Simply Awesome,B07XMD275S
"I am glad that i choosed this one over other brands and even bigger brands. Pros: Seamless internet connectivity Easy interface Awesome colors whether SD or HD Shortcuts app buttons on remote All app woking well. Amazon app had an issue, however updating android feom app and resetting the tv resolved this. Working with out any lag now. Played games in 32 inches version and compeltely a good experience. Pairing easy with blutooth devices. Jio cimema supported. Cons: Volumen is loud, but 100% clear. This does not mean it will impact voice, buy this without any hesitation. No blutooth remote which is necceessary now a days. Its not there i guess in any of the size i guess but not sure. ChromeCast does not work very well. Lag on the screen, i can say its not usable in this kind of lag Not much content available.",This Tv beats big brands!,B07XMD275S
"OK this is an update. The sound stopped working after 5 days but has since come back. Don't know why. Amazon not helpful on the matter in any case. The menu is slow but it's a good picture, and sound (when it works). Easy to set up. Just play and play. Very light in weight. Only gripe is when Sky box is on, the volume control on the sky isn't working. Only TV volume works. Voice recognition doesn't work at all.",It's OK.,B07XMD275S

Just got the TV installed after a long wait(with VU dealer) . Picture quality is good. Sound quality is okay. Recommended to keep in standard mode if you don't have a external sound system. One last suggestion is DON'T DEPEND ON THE AMAZON SERVICE GUYS TO ASSIST FOR INSTALLATION.. THEY CHEAT YOU. After so much follow and Email exchange... We had to finally call the customer service of VU and get it INSTALLED FROM THE AUTHORIZED VU DEALER........ Happy with Product.

"I bought this after comparing it with many other branded TVs such as Samsung, Xiaomi, LG, Motorola, etc. But finally decided to buy this because it's an Indian brand and the features and quality it offers are comparable to those Big brands as Samsung and LG and can easily beat Chinese made TVs in terms of display and sound quality & clarity. I recommend this TV to all those who are in a tight budget but want a really good picture quality and sound in a TV that too from an Indian Brand. Also latest Android 9.0, Bluetooth 5.0 and Chromcast works very well. The interface is easy to operate. Also, you get five shortcut keys for each streaming media (Hotstar, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Youtube) in remote itself, so no hassle. I faced no connectivity issues so far. As far as voice control is concerned, one can use their smartphones to operate their tv via Google Assistance, you just need to download the Google assistance app and apply settings to it.",Best Offering from an Indian Brand.,B07XMD275S

"40"" Bought in 16010/- (with icici discount). Amazon allow to check product with ""free open box verification"" which is really helful. Nice picture clarity, good contrast ratio, there is li'l bit vibrating voice/music on high volume, 1080i videos plays smoothly. But wait.... there is lot of hectic for installation. My TV has been installed after 19 days from the product delivery. after 1 time service man refuse to came due to traffic and 2 times VECARE (amazon's vendor) appoint the service man which was not belongs to my area.

"I got the 40 inch Vu Smart android TV and it is just awesome at this price. I bought it in amazon sale. Initially all the apps(Netflix, Youtube, Hotstar, Zee5) were working fine expect prime video which was disappointing but the installation guy installed some update of 840 MB, reset the TV settings and then all apps were working smoothly. The clarity is amazing and is visible clearly from any angle. Though I was not impressed with the sound but that can be ignored as most of the TV's do not have awesome sound. I have compensated that with JBL soundbar and now its superb experience for me. For this price range this Vu TV fulfills all the criteria and if you want are planning to buy go for this.",Very nice for this price range.,B07XMD275S
"It's been 10 days and so far my experience with VU Ultra Android range has been phenomenal. The picture quality is really vibrant and vivid. The colours are perfect in this range. The display is far better than it's competitors and also the colours seem pretty natural. Coming to the sound section, the 20W surround sound Dolby system is absolutely mind blowing. The voice is clear and the music just mellows your ears. The bass and everything is pretty good and at this price point everything works phenomenal. Netflix works perfectly. Every other Android supported application runs the same. The Chromecast feature also works flawlessly. The only issue I have faced is with Amazon Prime video. The TV supports the app. But the app has not been registered with Vu TVs till now. So registering of the device doesn't work. So using amazon video works currently with Chromecast feature only. Apart from this everything is perfect.",Best Smart TV under 20k,B07XMD275S

"The installer came and gave a quick demo but was not equipped to activate the voice recognition feature. Hence I have given a blank rating on that. The screen cast / mirroring experience is pathetic. The audio is immediately casted from my Android phone to the TV, but the pictures follow after a delay of over 20 secs. I have absolutely no delay when I use a Chromecast device cast fitted on a normal (non-Smart) Sanyo TV over the same wi-fi network. The users manual is also below expectation. It does not even mention the exact model of the TV set purchased. So I am left wondering whether they made a packing mistake or just don't care about perfection.","Promised a world class experience, but fell short",B07XMD275S

First VU TV and its very impressive. As Usual amazon is the best when it comes to delivery and products. Box contains wall mount as well as stand. The Display panel is what impress me the most.

The Os and everything is good but the sound speakers distorts so much that it is noticeable and is really annoying For people geeting same problem i would recommend them using the tv in user sound mode (it can be changed thround S Mode button on remote) or by going to settings and use equalizer detail and reduce 150-200 hz by at least -40db Overall it is a best for value tv but however the sound issue is really annoying (idk if only i am getting it),Sound issue,B07XMD275S

"When VU launched in India with LCD screen, i was impressed by there picture quality during that time. My First LCD was from VU which didn't gave issue for good 7 Years. After that it started giving LCD panel issue and went blank. Since Technologies changed LED gave better quality i thought to go for the VU LED TV. These was the second from VU, which i bought 2 years back. Today as i Write this second VU product gave the same issue, LED Panel display has gone blank. When the VU technician visit to check the issue, the option given is to replace the Display Panel. Which cost equivalent to new one. Also they have scripted answer, with Humidity /moisture this are common issues. I read some of the blogs this is one of the common issue reported by other user. With 2 experience by now the hefty cost for repair, i would recommend anyone to please give a second thought before buying VU products and life span of display. As on today VU have discontinued both the products which I had bought.",VU LCd/LED Panel has poor lifespan,B07XMD275S

"Amazing product from VU...This is my first Smart HD TV, and I realize what I have been missing all these years.... It's a beautiful looking TV, Picture Quality is life like (at recommend viewing distant), Sound is ample enough to fill a room with crisp and clear output (don't spend money buying a sound bar for this TV) and the apps are pretty Swift and easy to navigate (I mean not as swiftly as you can on your laptop or phones, but you'll get the hang of it). Only miss is the voice control remote, would have saved a lot of time typing the content name and don't even think of the Android TV remote its useless But Overall it's definitely an outright winner in the price range of 20k",It's the Mike Tyson of Smart HD TV in budget,B07XMD275S

"While everyone here is complaining about prime video thing, surprised that nobody mentioned the horrendous picture quality here. pixelation and washed out images are just too much of a pain and eye sore. made the mistake of buying a 43 inch, i would advise anyone else buying, go ahead and make the purchase, good product but get the 40 inch one instead, hopefully better picture quality on that. after my usage of a day, only streaming services, zee5, hotstar, google play movies, youtube, netflix, amazon prime, the picture quality for me is far away from a pleasing experience. images look quite a bit washed out and sometime over saturated, horrible contrast. get a DTH if you buying this, avoid using streaming service, picture quality is just awful. and yeah i do have a 200mbps connection, so no stream quality issue, but issue with the image quality on this tv.",Not that much interesting.,B07XMD275S
